                    Virgil Goode, the presidential nominee for the conservative Constitution Party, qualified for Virginia's ballot on Tuesday, complicating Mitt Romney's chances of winning the swing state. Polls show a tightly contested race there between Mr. Romney and President Obama.        

                    The Virginia State Board of Elections announced on Tuesday that Mr. Goode's name would appear third on the ballot, after the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees.        

                    At the same time, the board asked Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the state's Republican attorney general, to investigate Republican accusations that Mr. Goode's party used fraudulent signatures to qualify for the election.        

                    ''Candidate Romney, before he continues campaigning, should read the First Amendment about free speech and the right to petition,'' Mr. Goode, below, said Tuesday. ''They're afraid true conservatives will vote for me.''        

                    The Republican Party of Virginia vowed to continue its fight to knock Mr. Goode's name off the ballot. Pat Mullins, the party chairman in Virginia, accused Mr. Goode of ''systemic problems'' in his signature petitions and said they were worthy of a criminal investigation.        

                    ''These problems display, at best, a stunning disregard for Virginia law,'' Mr. Mullins said.        

                    For now, Republicans, must figure out how to handle the new presidential competitor. Mr. Goode, a former congressman from Virginia, may not win many votes, but in a close election they could have outsize significance. JONATHAN WEISMAN
