Deliberations in the federal corruption trial of former Senator John Edwards stretched into a seventh day on Tuesday, with little indication that a decision was near. Noting that high school graduation season had arrived, Judge Catherine C. Eagles asked the jury to send her any potential coming conflicts. The stress inside the courtroom has built steadily as the jury seeks a verdict in the trial that began April 23. But on Tuesday, the judge inadvertently injected a little tension-relieving humor. “The jury sent me a note saying they have reached a,” she said, causing nearly every observer to jerk to attention. After a moment, she continued: “good stopping point.” The courtroom erupted in laughter and Abbe Lowell, Mr. Edwards’s lead lawyer, dropped his head to the defense table. “That was mean. I’m sorry,” the judge said.
