                    TAMPA, Fla. - More than 20 million people tuned in to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night, and more of them watched on Fox News than on any other channel by far.        

                    According to preliminary ratings, 6.9 million people tuned in to Fox News from 10 to 11 p.m., the hour that featured the evening's major speeches, by Ann Romney and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.        

                    That was the only hour that the three broadcast networks carried the convention live on Tuesday.        

                    NBC pulled in 4.8 million viewers, the second most. CBS followed with 3.1 million; ABC had 2.9 million; and CNN and MSNBC were virtually tied with 1.5 million each.        

                    Final numbers won't be available until later in the day. But these figures appear to put the ratings for Tuesday, the first full day of convention proceedings, on par with the first full day of the Republican convention in 2008. About 21.5 million people tuned in then.        

                    Fox News was also the most-watched channel then, drawing 6.2 million people.        

                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
