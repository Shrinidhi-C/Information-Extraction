                    Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee raised about $100 million in August, a person briefed on the total said on Tuesday.        

                    It was the Republicans' third nine-figure month in a row, putting Mr. Romney on pace to be one of the most successful Republican fund-raisers in history. Most of the money, raised in a series of joint party fund-raisers, will flow to the national committee and other party committees participating in the effort, which can accept far larger checks from individuals than Mr. Romney's campaign can.        

                    The August totals were shared with top Romney donors last week and were first reported by Politico.        

                    The leaders of the joint arrangement -- similar to one between President Obama and the Democratic National Committee -- are hoping to bring in a total of $800 million by the end of the cycle, slightly more than Mr. Obama's stated goal.        

                    Priorities USA Action, the Democratic ''super PAC'' backing Mr. Obama, raised $10 million in August, as concerns grew among some elite Democratic contributors that outside Republican groups would swamp Mr. Obama's re-election effort.        

                    The group, founded by two former Obama aides, had never before raised as much in a month. Yet the group's overall fund-raising is far behind that of super PACs and other groups, like American Crossroads and Restore Our Future, that support Mr. Romney and other Republican candidates.
