Jurors in the corruption trial of John Edwards ended their sixth day of deliberations without reaching a verdict and will not come back to court until Tuesday because of the holiday weekend. Before dismissing the jury, Judge Catherine C. Eagles briefly cleared the courtroom of spectators to discuss a “juror issue” with the prosecution and defense lawyers. Once she reopened court, she warned the jurors to discuss the case only when the full complement of 12 was present. “You shouldn’t talk about the case in small groups,” she said. She also planned to resume court at 9 a.m. in case the jury issue needed more attention. Jury behavior has drawn attention in recent days. On Thursday, the four alternate jurors came to court in yellow shirts. On Friday, they wore red. Two of the women alternates also giggled and glanced at Mr. Edwards, prompting speculation by courtroom observers that at least one of them was flirting.
