<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> is heading to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with President <Entity>Enrique Peña Nieto,</Entity> but one of the Mexican leader’s predecessors had a different message for the Republican presidential nominee: You are not welcome here.
<Entity>Vicente Fox,</Entity> Mexico’s president from 2000 to 2006, said on Wednesday that the invitation from Mr. <Entity>Peña Nieto</Entity> was a mistake and that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> should never be trusted in the country because of the way he has demonized its people.
“He is not welcome to Mexico,” Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> told CNN. “We don’t want him. We reject his visit.”
Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> has been critical of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> plan to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico and on Wednesday he shrugged off recent signs of Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> softening his plans to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.
“You cannot trust a guy like this,” Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> said. “How can we grant confidence and support to ideas that change everyday? He cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans.”
Despite Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> promises that Mexico will pay for his border wall, Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> vowed in February that it would never happen. He also called Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> a “false prophet” who was misleading his followers.
On Wednesday, Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> expressed disbelief that Mr. <Entity>Peña Nieto</Entity> would invite Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> for the private meeting. He suggested that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> was only coming as part of a “desperate” strategy to improve his sagging poll numbers and in explicit terms he urged Americans not to vote for him.
“I cannot envision him sitting in that chair, that was the chair of President <Entity>Washington,</Entity> President <Entity>Jefferson,</Entity> President <Entity>Kennedy,</Entity> President <Entity>Reagan,”</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> said. “He doesn’t know how to run a nation. He doesn’t even know how to run a business.”
As he prepared to travel to Mexico, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> responded to Mr. <Entity>Fox’s</Entity> attacks, noting on Twitter that the former Mexican president once suggested that he pay the country a visit.
Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> fired back with a Twitter post of his own, reminding Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> that he invited him to come to Mexico and personally apologize to all Mexicans.
“Stop lying!” Mr. <Entity>Fox</Entity> wrote. “Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.”
