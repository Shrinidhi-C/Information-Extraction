With only six days left in the presidential race, <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> and <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> are working overtime to turn out voters, but their power to shift the direction of the race diminishes every day.
Both campaigns still have important decisions to make as they fine-tune their approaches — decisions that could affect who wins, and also how that person wins and how the victory is interpreted.
Some of the key dynamics we are watching in a race that will undoubtedly twist and turn to the end:
<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> raised $100 million in small donations in October, his campaign announced on Thursday. But Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> announcement — made in a news release sent to reporters late in the afternoon — contained few other details, and his figures cannot be independently verified until after Election Day, when the winning and losing campaigns file their next financial disclosures with the Federal Election Commission.
Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> tally appeared to include money raised into party accounts he jointly controls, but did not specify what threshold he used for “small” donations, and a spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for clarification. The release did not specify whether the total represented any money that was raised earlier in the year but was only recently transferred into his campaign accounts.
The <Entity>Trump</Entity> team’s last official F.E.C. report was filed last week and covered the first 19 days of October. Using a conventional measure of small donations — checks from people giving less than $200 — Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would have had to raise about $65 million from small contributions during the remaining days in October, effectively tripling his clip with these donors. That would be a huge jump.
But it is also possible that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is including contributions of more than $200 in his tally, since he has been collecting relatively few large checks. If Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> figure included all the money raised in the first part of October, then he would have had to raise $40 million to reach $100 million by the end of the month.
That would leave him at more or less on the same pace as earlier in the month — and only a slightly faster clip than in September.
In a statement accompanying Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> news release, his digital director, <Entity>Brad Parscale,</Entity> said: “Hitting a 100 million dollar goal in October is an amazing milestone for the campaign as it shows how Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> message is resonating with millions of voters across the country.”
The killing of two police officers in the Des Moines area has caused the Clinton campaign to change its schedule.
<Entity>Tim Kaine,</Entity> former President <Entity>Bill Clinton</Entity> and the singer <Entity>Ben Harper</Entity> were planning a get-out-the vote performance at the Des Moines Social Club on Wednesday night, but the event was scrapped because of the tragedy.
Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> who has in the past used attacks on police to amplify his “law and order” message, offered a measured response and said that he was praying for the families of the officers.
“An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on all of us,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> wrote in a post on Twitter.
For Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the difference between trailing Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> by a little and trailing by a lot has often been the strength of his backing from other Republicans. Campaigning on a set of themes unlike any other recent Republican nominee, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has occasionally fallen behind by landslide margins when conservative-leaning voters shifted away from him.
Shunned by many party leaders, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is plainly still working to rally Republicans: His running mate, Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence</Entity> of Indiana, has been publicly pleading with partisans to “come home” to their presidential ticket. Mr. <Entity>Pence</Entity> is campaigning in Arizona on Wednesday, a traditionally conservative state where Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has struggled.
Republican support alone cannot make Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> the next president. But only by improving and cementing his support on the right can Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> get close to Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> on Election Day and leave a lasting mark on the party he has helmed since spring.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> are largely battling over a handful of big swing states: Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. But both are also traveling outside the traditional map this week and throwing money at television commercials in unexpected places.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was in Arizona on Wednesday, seeking to exploit Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> weakness with Hispanic voters and suburban whites. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> visited Michigan and New Mexico earlier in the week, trying to find new paths to victory in the Electoral College, where Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> holds a considerable advantage. But he returned to conventional turf on Wednesday, with three stops in Florida on his schedule.
While Democrats express confidence that they can repel Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> forays, they are leaving little to chance: Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> now plans to visit Detroit on Friday. If Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> finds his path forward continually frustrated, could he add another long-shot state or two?
Although <Entity>Gary Johnson,</Entity> the Libertarian Party nominee, has been dropping in most polls since he was left out of the presidential debates, the ticket could still have an impact in a close race, given its popularity in states such as New Mexico and Colorado.
Confusing the matter is the fact that <Entity>William F. Weld,</Entity> the party’s vice-presidential nominee, essentially endorsed Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in an interview with MSNBC’s <Entity>Rachel Maddow</Entity> on Tuesday night.
“Well I’m here vouching for Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and I think it’s high time somebody did and I’m doing it based on my personal experience with her and I think she deserves to have people vouch for her,” Mr. <Entity>Weld</Entity> said when asked if his loyalty to the Libertarian Party was stronger than his fear of a <Entity>Trump</Entity> presidency.
Mr. <Entity>Weld,</Entity> a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, acknowledged that he and Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> have many policy disagreements and that they no longer have a chance to win the presidency this year.
For his part, Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> has kept up his attacks on Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and in a debate with <Entity>Jill Stein,</Entity> the Green Party nominee, he suggested that she would be “engaged in the impeachment process” on day one if elected.
With his fired-up return to the trail on Tuesday, Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> showed again why he is Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> most valuable surrogate. He is the most popular person in national politics and perhaps uniquely effective at reaching black voters and young people at a moment when Democrats are anxious about turnout. That makes him a powerful asset to Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in a state like North Carolina, where he campaigned on Wednesday.
“I hate to put pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders,” Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> said at rally in North Carolina.
She has largely been absent since the Republican convention in July, but Ms. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will make an appearance on behalf of her husband in suburban Philadelphia on Thursday.
According to the campaign, Ms. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will “address the American people to get out the vote and share what a <Entity>Trump</Entity> Administration’s vision would be like for American women, children and families” at the event at the Main Line Sports Center in Berwyn.
Ms. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has maintained that she has kept a low profile so that she can focus on raising her young child, but the campaign hinted that she would help her husband make his final pitch to voters.
