<Entity>Donald Trump Jr.</Entity> invoked Holocaust imagery when complaining about media favoritism given toward <Entity>Hillary Clinton,</Entity> arguing that if Republicans lied the way Democrats do, the press would be “warming up the gas chamber right now.”
The <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign has been complaining aggressively that the mainstream media is working against the candidacy of <Entity>Donald J. Trump,</Entity> who has recently been giving most of his interviews to conservative outlets. In an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Wednesday, the younger Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said that the media has built up Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and that it is her No. 1 surrogate.
“They’ve let her slide on every discrepancy, on every lie, on every D.N.C. game trying to get <Entity>Bernie Sanders</Entity> out of this thing,” said Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the candidate’s oldest son, alluding to the Democratic National Committee. “If Republicans were doing that, they’d be warming up the gas chamber right now.”
The comments come as the <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign has faced criticism for failing to sufficiently disavow support from the so-called alt-right movement, a group widely considered white supremacists and who often express anti-Semitic views.
Last week, <Entity>Donald Trump Jr.</Entity> drew a backlash for pushing back against Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> “basket of deplorables” comment by posting on Instagram an image that included Pepe the Frog. The frog is a popular alt-right symbol.
Holocaust references can be something of a third rail in American politics. Last year Republicans called on <Entity>Mike Huckabee</Entity> to apologize when he said that President <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> Iran policy would “take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven.”
The gas chamber comment was quickly picked up in the Israeli press and critics of Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> such as the independent presidential candidate <Entity>Evan McMullin,</Entity> who said that the statement was revealing.
“An unsurprising Nazi reference from the ‘alt-right’ movement’s presidential campaign,” Mr. <Entity>McMullin</Entity> wrote in a post on Twitter. “This is the real <Entity>Trump.”</Entity>
The Anti-Defamation League also scolded <Entity>Donald Trump Jr.</Entity> for showing a lack of sensitivity about the Holocaust.
The group, which works to combat anti-Semitism, called on him to retract his comment.
A spokesman for the <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign, <Entity>Jason Miller,</Entity> said that Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> words were being twisted for political purposes. “Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> campaign,” Mr. <Entity>Miller</Entity> said.
<Entity>Donald Trump Jr.’s</Entity> sister, <Entity>Ivanka,</Entity> is a convert to Judaism.
