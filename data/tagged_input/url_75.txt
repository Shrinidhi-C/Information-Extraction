For months, a central question of the 2016 presidential race has been how much distance <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> needs to keep between herself and President <Entity>Obama.</Entity>
In the last 50 years, voters have shown little interest in backing the candidate of the same party as a sitting president. (The exception is <Entity>George Bush,</Entity> who succeeded <Entity>Ronald Reagan.)</Entity>
But the country has grown drastically more partisan in recent years. Mrs. Clinton is relying on support from the <Entity>Obama</Entity> coalition to be elected. And Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> is relying on her to continue his legacy.
And so the two will make their first joint campaign appearance next week, in Wisconsin, one of a series of events they are expected to hold together.
Over the course of a toxic presidential race, both Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> have accrued historically high negative ratings in polls. Mr. <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> numbers, perhaps as a result of the vitriolic presidential race, have improved. And he hopes that his endorsement of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> announced after he held a meeting on Thursday with her rival, <Entity>Bernie Sanders,</Entity> will bring the Vermont senator’s supporters to her side.
Still, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> needs to maintain a separate political identity from Mr. <Entity>Obama’s.</Entity> And so, while the accelerated endorsement from Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> was welcomed by Democrats who have been urging the party to unite, the general-election campaign needs to remain Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> show.
