<Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> received a surge of support after the Democratic National Convention, according to a new national poll that showed her opening a lead against <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> with fewer than 100 days to go before the presidential election.
The CBS News survey released on Monday shows 46 percent of registered voters backing Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and 39 percent supporting Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the Republican nominee. That represents a four-percentage-point bounce for Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> who was deadlocked with Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> after the Republican convention, which gave Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> a two-point increase.
When <Entity>Gary Johnson,</Entity> the Libertarian Party’s nominee, is added to the mix he receives 10 percent of the vote and Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> holds a five-point lead.
The CBS poll found that the Democratic convention improved Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> favorability rating and her standing with female voters, a group that was already strongly in her corner. She continues to trail Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> with men and white voters who do not have college degrees.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> post-convention bounce was in line with the upticks that President <Entity>Obama</Entity> received in 2008 and 2012. It was smaller than the 13-point increase that her husband, former President <Entity>Bill Clinton,</Entity> saw in 1992 or the 10-point bounce that <Entity>Al Gore</Entity> got in 2000.
Post-convention bounces have been decreasing in recent years as the electorate has become more polarized.
Despite some protests from backers of Senator <Entity>Bernie Sanders,</Entity> the Democratic convention was widely praised for being well-choreographed, with splashy musical performances and high-profile speeches from Mr. <Entity>Obama,</Entity> <Entity>Michelle Obama,</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and Vice President <Entity>Joseph R. Biden Jr.</Entity>
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> made headway in uniting the party, according to the CBS poll, with improved support from liberals and those who were hoping that Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> would be the Democratic Party’s nominee.
Earlier in July, two-thirds of Mr. <Entity>Sanders’s</Entity> supporters said they would vote for Mrs. <Entity>Clinton.</Entity> After the convention, however, 73 percent said that they supported her.
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
