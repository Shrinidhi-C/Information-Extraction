CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. — On a bright Election Day morning, <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> cast a vote for herself for president, the final step of a turbulent 19-month campaign.
Inside the cramped auditorium of <Entity>Douglas G. Grafflin</Entity> Elementary School, neighbors and supporters swarmed around Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and former President <Entity>Bill Clinton</Entity> to catch a glimpse. Fathers hoisted their daughters on their shoulders and mothers held babies in the air to get a photo of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> bent down to fill out her ballot.
“It’s a humbling feeling,” Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> told reporters as she shook hands with supporters gathered outside the polling location.
“I know how much responsibility goes with this,” she added, “so many people are counting on the outcome of this election and what it means for our country.”
Asked if she thought of her mother, <Entity>Dorothy Rodham,</Entity> who was born on the day Congress approved women’s right to vote, and whose impoverished childhood formed the backbone of her daughter’s campaign, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> replied, “Oh, I did.”
After voting Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> went back to her house, about a five-minute drive from the school, and did a string of interviews to encourage people to vote.
“I was glad to see there were lots of people out to vote,” she told a Detroit radio station.
Later on Tuesday, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and her top aides planned to decamp to a Midtown hotel to fine-tune the two versions of the speech she planned to deliver at the Javits Center, and to watch the results come in to see which version of that speech she would end up giving.
