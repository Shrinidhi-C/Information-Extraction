<Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> and <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> are deadlocked in the crucial swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, according to new polls showing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee gaining strength on his Democratic rival because of doubts about her honesty.
Surveys from Quinnipiac University show the two candidates statistically tied in the states going into their party conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia this month. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> leads Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in Florida by three percentage points, 42 percent to 39 percent. In Pennsylvania, he is ahead by two points, 43 percent to 41 percent. And in Ohio they are tied, with each having support of 41 percent of voters.
When <Entity>Gary Johnson,</Entity> the Libertarian Party nominee, and <Entity>Jill Stein,</Entity> the Green Party’s candidate, are included in the polls, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> does even better, leading Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> by five points in Florida, six points in Pennsylvania and one point in Ohio. Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> is expected to be on ballots in all 50 states.
The polls, which have margins of error of plus or minus three percentage points, show improvement for Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> in Pennsylvania and Florida, where he is starting to do better with women and independent voters while gaining more support among men. In June, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> held small leads over Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> in Florida and Pennsylvania and they were tied in Ohio.
For Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the polls suggest he has weathered a rough stretch of controversies and campaign upheaval. For Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> the numbers could raise concern that the recent attention on her email practices as secretary of state has taken a toll. The Department of Justice has dropped the case, but several of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> statements were disputed by the F.B.I., which said she was “extremely careless” with classified information.
“While there is no definite link between <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> drop in Florida and the U.S. Justice Department decision not to prosecute her for her handling of emails, she has lost ground to Trump on questions which measure moral standards and honesty,” said <Entity>Peter A. Brown,</Entity> assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll.
Voters in all three states are looking for “radical change” and are unhappy with the way trade deals have affected America’s economy. While Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> is viewed as being more prepared to be president, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is seen as the more honest candidate and better suited to fight terrorism.
Despite the progress, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> continues to struggle in some areas. For instance, in Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, he is winning only 21 percent of nonwhite voters.
But he is also making progress with other important voting blocs. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has struggled with female voters in many national polls, but in Pennsylvania he has narrowed the gender gap. He currently trails Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> by just four points, down from 16 points in June.
Both candidates are expected to campaign aggressively in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida ahead of the November election. No candidate has won the presidency without winning two of those three states since 1960, Quinnipiac notes.
<Entity>“Donald Trump</Entity> enters the Republican convention on a small roll in the three most important swing states in the country,” Mr. <Entity>Brown</Entity> said.
Separate polls released on Wednesday by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist also showed Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> and Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> statistically tied in Ohio and Iowa. In Pennsylvania, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> holds a solid advantage, topping Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> by nine percentage points, 45 percent to 36 percent.
As with the Quinnipiac polls, the surveys show Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> gaining ground in the last month.
