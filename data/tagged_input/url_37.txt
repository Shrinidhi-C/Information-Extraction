• Of Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> said she hoped that he would be “a successful president for all Americans,” and that she respected and cherished the peaceful transition of power. She told her supporters that they must accept that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would be president. “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,” she said. But she also acknowledged that the country was more divided than she had realized.
• After a long campaign, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> acknowledged that the loss cuts deep. “This is painful, and it will be for a long time,” she said. She also expressed regret that she did not shatter the glass ceiling, but said, “Someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.”
• Senator <Entity>Tim Kaine</Entity> of Virginia, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who spoke before Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> said, “I’m proud of <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> because she has been and is a great history maker,” pointing to her long career of public service. He saluted her for winning the popular vote in the election, drawing cheers.
• Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> said that he and former President <Entity>George W. Bush</Entity> had major differences eight years ago, but they managed a successful transition. He said he expected to do the same with Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> while acknowledging that they have their differences, and he invited the president-elect to come to the White House on Thursday.

Biden Jr.</Entity> by his side. “But the path this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag.”
The Vermont senator, who ran against Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in the Democratic primary campaign, was silent on the election for most of Wednesday, but in the early evening he offered something of an olive branch to Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> and acknowledged the middle class anger that he tapped into.
“To the degree that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,” Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> said in a statement.
But Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> maintained that he is opposed to much of what Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has stood for and that he will fight any intolerance that he might try to promote as president.
“To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him,” Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> said.
Mr. <Entity>Ryan</Entity> congratulated Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> for accomplishing an “enormous political feat” on Wednesday and said that he was looking forward to working with him to carry forward a Republican policy agenda and prioritize the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
“This health care law is not a popular law,” Mr. <Entity>Ryan</Entity> said, adding that Congress had already shown it can get a repeal bill to the president’s desk. “This health care law is collapsing of its own weight.”
That clearly indicated that Republican leaders would use budget rules, called reconciliation, to gut the Affordable Care Act with only a majority of Congress, as they did in January. Senate Democrats would be powerless to filibuster the legislation under the parliamentary rules.
Mr. <Entity>Ryan,</Entity> who has had differences with Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> said that they had spoken twice in the last 18 hours and that he was “very excited” about their ability to work together.
“He just earned a mandate,” Mr. <Entity>Ryan</Entity> said.
The last two Republican presidents gave the next Republican president congratulatory telephone calls on Wednesday.
<Entity>“Laura</Entity> and I wish the president-elect, <Entity>Melania</Entity> and the entire <Entity>Trump</Entity> family all our very best as they take on an awesome responsibility and begin an exciting new chapter in their lives,” former President <Entity>George W. Bush</Entity> said in a statement.
Mr. <Entity>Bush</Entity> had been critical of Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> when he was campaigning on behalf of his brother <Entity>Jeb</Entity> this year but said that he was rooting for Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> now.
“We pray for the success of our country and the success of our new president,” Mr. <Entity>Bush</Entity> said.
Mr. <Entity>Bush’s</Entity> father, <Entity>George Bush,</Entity> the 41st president, also spoke to Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> on Wednesday. A spokesman said that they talked for about five minutes and that the call was friendly and gracious.
“Good luck on your new challenge,” Mr. <Entity>Bush</Entity> said.
<Entity>Jeb Bush,</Entity> the former Florida governor vanquished by Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> during the Republican primary process, sent Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> a congratulatory message on Twitter.
Dozens of Republican elected officials resisted Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> rise to power, including some who revoked their endorsements in the heat of the general election. Senators like <Entity>Lindsey Graham</Entity> of South Carolina and <Entity>John McCain</Entity> of Arizona declared Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> unfit to lead, while ideological conservatives like <Entity>Ben Sasse</Entity> of Nebraska and <Entity>Mike Lee</Entity> of Utah warned of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> indifference to the limits of government power.
These <Entity>Trump</Entity> critics on the right now face a wrenching political choice: to defer to him as the country’s new leader, or to take up a quasi-oppositional role against a Republican as he assembles his administration. Since Republicans kept control of the House and Senate, dissenters within Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> party may hold outsize influence over exactly how he can govern as president.
Mr. <Entity>Graham</Entity> took a reserved approach in his statement on the election on Tuesday, saying that he would aim to help Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> govern — within the bounds of a fairly conventional Republican agenda.
