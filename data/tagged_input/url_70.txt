COLUMBUS, Ohio — <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> disparaged the economic record and policy acumen of <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> in a speech on Tuesday, suggesting his ideas were ill-considered and scrutinizing his own checkered business history.
Some of the highlights:
• Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> said the American economy “isn’t yet where we want it to be, but we are stronger and better positioned than anyone in the world.” She trumpeted her fiscal record as a senator from New York.
• She said that, like Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> foreign policy ideas, his economic proposals were dangerous. “Just like he shouldn’t have his finger on the button, he shouldn’t have his hands on our economy,” Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> said.
• Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> cited a series of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> past controversial comments about issues like the minimum wage. She said Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> had also “said all kinds of things about women in the workforce. He once called pregnant employees — and I quote — ‘an inconvenience.’”
• Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> who has often been criticized for her ties to Wall Street, suggested Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would “take us back to where we were before the crisis” and “rig the economy for Wall Street again.” She also assailed Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> comments appraising himself as the “king of debt.”
• Predicting that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would cause a recession, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> noted that the global economy “hangs on every word our president says.” She said Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> suggesting that the United States might default on its debt could start “a global panic” if he were president.
• Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> described the process of constructing her speech: “I had my researchers and my speech writers send me information” on Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> “and then I’d say, ‘Really? He really said that?’ And they’d send me all the background and the video clip.”
• Observing that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> had not released his tax returns, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> speculated that he might be “afraid” of voters seeing what they would reveal. “Maybe he isn’t as rich as he claims,” she said.
• As Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> posted on Twitter to counter Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> remarks, she ticked off a list of foreign countries where Trump-branded products had been made.
• The crowd laughed when Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> discussed Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> record with casinos in Atlantic City and the bankruptcies of his companies. She said Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> had “written a lot of books about business” and added, “They all seem to end at Chapter 11.”
• Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> raised the controversy surrounding Trump University, which has been sued for fraud. “This is his one move. He makes over-the-top promises,” she said, “then everything falls apart and people get hurt.”
• Invoking her deceased father’s small business, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> said Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> had refused to pay contractors for work they had completed. “So I take this personally,” she said.
• Wrapping a 45-minute speech, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> reiterated a campaign theme — “Stronger Together”— and argued that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> “believes in the worst of us.” As she spoke, the <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign sent news releases to reporters raising questions about Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> conduct and judgment.
