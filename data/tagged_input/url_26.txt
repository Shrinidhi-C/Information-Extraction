WASHINGTON — Call it the two birds, one tweet approach: As he continues to feud with Senator <Entity>Bob Corker,</Entity> President <Entity>Trump</Entity> is now also blaming the Tennessee Republican for the Iran nuclear deal that the White House is threatening to decertify, perhaps as soon as this week.
But it is a misleading charge: Mr. <Entity>Corker,</Entity> who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, repeatedly spoke out against the accord to limit Tehran’s nuclear program before it was brokered by world powers in 2015.
<Entity>“Bob Corker</Entity> gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> tweeted on Sunday.
On Tuesday, the White House offered details. “Senator <Entity>Corker</Entity> worked with <Entity>Nancy Pelosi</Entity> and the <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration to pave the way for that legislation, and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal,” <Entity>Sarah Huckabee Sanders,</Entity> the White House press secretary, told reporters, referring to the House Democratic leader.
She was talking about a bill that Mr. <Entity>Corker</Entity> sponsored and pushed through in the spring of 2015 to give Congress some say over the deal, as Republicans demanded at the time.
In a March 12, 2015, letter to President <Entity>Barack Obama,</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Corker</Entity> said that an agreement without a congressional vote would be “a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress’s appropriate role.”
Mr. <Entity>Corker’s</Entity> bipartisan bill, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, essentially gave Congress 30 days to review the deal, and additional time to override a veto from the president.
Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> opposed the bill initially — as did the National Iranian American Council — and White House officials repeatedly said the president would veto it. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which criticized the final accord, supported Mr. <Entity>Corker’s</Entity> bill.
Ultimately, <Entity>Josh Earnest,</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> spokesman, said that while the president was not “particularly thrilled” about the legislation, the White House viewed it as a compromise. Israel’s intelligence minister characterized the agreement between the White House and Congress as an “achievement for Israeli policy.”
A month later, Mr. <Entity>Corker’s</Entity> bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chambers, 98 to 1 in the Senate and 400 to 25 in the House, and became law on May 22, 2015.
After the final Iran deal was reached in July 2015, Mr. <Entity>Corker</Entity> urged his colleagues to reject it. Democrats blocked Republicans from doing so through procedural votes; Mr. <Entity>Corker</Entity> voted three times with his party. He also voted for an amendment to bar Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> from lifting sanctions on Iran, which did not survive a Democratic filibuster.
Ms. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> conceded Mr. <Entity>Corker’s</Entity> votes but said his bill legitimized the deal — even though the <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration had repeatedly suggested it did not need congressional approval for the agreement.
<Entity>Jack Goldsmith,</Entity> a professor at Harvard Law School and former senior Justice Department official, said at the time that Mr. <Entity>Corker’s</Entity> bill gave Congress power to delay the nuclear deal — even if it was unable to block it. “Absent the Iran Review Act, President <Entity>Obama</Entity> could have lifted U.S. sanctions last week,” Mr. <Entity>Goldsmith</Entity> wrote in July 2015.
