Shortly after President <Entity>Trump</Entity> fired F.B.I. Director <Entity>James B. Comey,</Entity> New York Times readers expressed optimism, outrage and skepticism across nytimes.com, Facebook and Twitter.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said he fired Mr. <Entity>Comey</Entity> over the F.B.I. investigation into <Entity>Hillary Clinton’s</Entity> private email server, but in his letter to Mr. <Entity>Comey,</Entity> the president hinted that he was also concerned about the investigation into his own administration’s ties to Russia.
That article received more than 6,500 comments approved by moderators, who review nearly every one before they are published on The Times’s digital platforms. Thousands more readers weighed in on The Times’s Facebook page.
Here are excerpts from the comments, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.
Readers believed Mr. <Entity>Comey</Entity> was doomed once he admitted that there was an investigation into the <Entity>Trump</Entity> administration’s dealings with Russia. Days before he was fired, Mr. <Entity>Comey</Entity> had asked for funds to continue that inquiry.
“It wasn’t hard to see this coming; the investigation into possible <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign dealings with Russia’s intelligence network has been a sharp sword hanging over the President’s head.
Being an opportunist, <Entity>[Trump]</Entity> just saw an opportunity to replace <Entity>Comey</Entity> with a more compliant F.B.I. director who will make the investigation go away.”
— <Entity>Nick Wright</Entity> in Halifax, Nova Scotia
“While I disagree with <Entity>Comey</Entity> and the <Entity>Clinton</Entity> emails, he was trying to walk between the Scylla and Charybdis of partisan politics and an open investigation of Russian tampering in the American election to help <Entity>Trump</Entity> win.”

Readers suggested that <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> own conduct necessitated the firing. 
“If you read the FACTS set forth in the Deputy Attorney General’s conclusions regarding <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> conduct, his temperament and his profound lack of judgment, you have to agree that POTUS had to fire him. Should have happened sooner. <Entity>Comey</Entity> was a mess. He was totally in the wrong job.”
— <Entity>R. Mackinnon</Entity> in Concord, Mass.
“I always thought <Entity>[Comey’s]</Entity> behavior in announcing the termination of the <Entity>Clinton</Entity> investigation while editorializing on her judgment was improper. His October surprise was beyond the pale. He should have been fired as soon as <Entity>Trump</Entity> took office. However, the timing of this firing is very suspect.”
— <Entity>Janice Fahey</Entity> on The Times’s Facebook page
Readers said that President <Entity>Trump</Entity> made a mistake in firing Mr. <Entity>Comey</Entity> and suggested that the president’s vanity led him to the decision.
“I think <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> remark about being ‘mildly nauseous’ about swaying the election is what sealed the deal. <Entity>Trump</Entity> lost face, and this is something he cannot allow. His pride and vanity will be his undoing.”
— <Entity>Susan</Entity> in West Virginia
<Entity>“Trump</Entity> played it wrong, If he was truly innocent of any wrongdoing, he should have allowed the investigations to play out proving it, then asking for <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> resignation afterwards.”
— <Entity>LISAG</Entity> in the South
“It is clear at this point that <Entity>Trump</Entity> is not a shrewd tactician and politician. I am increasingly confident that we are approaching a ‘Pride comes before the fall’ solution to this sad chapter in our political history.”
— <Entity>Michael</Entity> in New York
Readers praised Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> efficiency and hoped that the administration will turn its attention to other concerns. 
“Nothing to see here folks. Director got fired for doing a poor job. Nothing else. Go back to work. Health care on its way to Senate and tax reform (cuts) on the way. Stay on point.”
— <Entity>Toni</Entity> in Florida
“Excellent. Now the FBI can finally investigate <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> and the <Entity>Clinton</Entity> Foundation. Great leadership shown by our President and his administration.”
— <Entity>Jeff Yepsen</Entity> on The Times’ Facebook page
“Liberals have been calling for <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> head ever since he said he was reopening the investigation into <Entity>Clinton.</Entity> Well, today you got what you wanted, so what’s the problem?”
— <Entity>C. Golden</Entity> in the U.S. 
Readers were quick to draw comparisons to <Entity>Richard Nixon’s</Entity> Saturday Night Massacre, but others said the situation was more reminiscent of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> previous career in reality television. 
“We had the Saturday Night Massacre. Now we are having the ‘Saturday Night Live’ Massacre.”
— <Entity>Brodston</Entity> in Gretna, Neb.
“Please stop saying that <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> firing of <Entity>Comey</Entity> is <Entity>Nixon’s</Entity> Saturday Night Massacre all over again. At that time back in 1973, there had already been an independent Watergate special prosecutor in place for months, who had made great strides toward bringing the President to justice.
And the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both resigned in protest over <Entity>Nixon’s</Entity> decision, while Sessions and Rosenstein are complicit in <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> firing.
Our current predicament is not the Saturday Night Massacre 2.0. It is much more bleak.”
— <Entity>Josh</Entity> in New York
“This is not ‘The Apprentice.’ This is a man who has given decades to the service of our country. What does it say to others who serve?”
— <Entity>Susanna Griefen</Entity> in Vermont
