<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> and <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> are deadlocked in Ohio, according to a new poll that shows the crucial state very much in play as Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> prepares to accept the Republican Party’s presidential nomination in Cleveland on Thursday night.
A new survey from Suffolk University finds that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> and Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> each have the support of 44 percent of likely voters, with 11 percent still undecided. When third-party candidates such as <Entity>Gary Johnson,</Entity> the Libertarian Party nominee, and the Green Party’s <Entity>Jill Stein</Entity> are included, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> holds a four-point lead.
“It’s absolutely up for grabs,” said <Entity>David Paleologos,</Entity> director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center.
The poll is in line with other surveys of Ohio voters that show the race being very close. Ohio is a critical battleground that could dictate the outcome of the election, and both candidates are expected to campaign aggressively across the state.
Mr. <Entity>Paleologos</Entity> noted that there is a sharp contrast between how the candidates perform in urban centers such as Cleveland, which favors Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> and the outer counties that lean toward Mr. <Entity>Trump.</Entity> Although the addition of Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence</Entity> as Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> running mate has not had an immediate impact, Mr. <Entity>Paleologos</Entity> suggests that it could help him in areas that border Mr. <Entity>Pence’s</Entity> home state of Indiana.
Terrorism and the economy, which are seen as strong areas for Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> remain the most important issues to voters in Ohio. Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration has not turned off voters, as 48 percent support the idea and 45 percent oppose it.
Third-party candidates could end up being the deciding factor in the race in Ohio, as the 5 percent of the vote that Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> is getting is siphoning more support away from Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> than it is from Mrs. <Entity>Clinton.</Entity>
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
