In the case of the AIDS disinformation campaign, a similar argument about uncertainty over the disease’s origins proved beneficial for conspiracy theorists.
<Entity>Jakob Segal,</Entity> an East German biologist who promoted the Soviet campaign, seized on growing doubts from a theory that the virus had jumped from African green monkeys to humans. He called it “ludicrous” in an 1986 interview with the London Sunday Express and accused the American government of playing it up as a cover-up.
By 1987, the Soviets began to sour on the campaign as Moscow’s scientific establishment rebuked it.
Secretary of State <Entity>George P. Shultz</Entity> also accused <Entity>Mikhail S. Gorbachev,</Entity> who was then the leader of the Soviet Union, with hawking “bum dope about AIDS.” Mr. <Entity>Gorbachev</Entity> ordered the K.G.B. to stop spreading the conspiracy theory and after the collapse of the bloc, former Soviet intelligence officials owned up to it.
“These active measures may be tactically successful, but strategically they fail,” Dr. <Entity>Selvage</Entity> said.
“In the case of the AIDS disinformation campaign, they were forced to give up on it,” he said. And of election meddling, “if the goal of the Russian government was to get a U.S. government that was favorable to lifting sanctions, it essentially backfired.”
Dr. <Entity>Boghardt</Entity> had a slightly different take. The approach of disinformation is basic, but “it works,” he said.
“Throw enough dirt, and some will stick,” he said. “This is what they’ve internalized. It didn’t win them the Cold War, but it did undermine the credibility of the West and American institutions.”
