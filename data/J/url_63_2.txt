• Mr. <Entity>Gingrich</Entity> took the stage after a brief introduction by his wife, <Entity>Callista,</Entity> and attempted to clean up the non-endorsement by Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> that sent the night into momentary chaos. Citing Mr. <Entity>Cruz’s</Entity> line that “you can vote your conscience,” Mr. <Entity>Gingrich</Entity> offered “to paraphrase <Entity>Ted Cruz:</Entity> if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible choice is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket.”
He then transitioned to a long list of national security failures, portraying Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> as the only candidate who can handle the foreign policy threats facing the country, before returning to a closing call for unity.

• Gov. <Entity>Scott Walker</Entity> of Wisconsin, a one-time <Entity>Trump</Entity> rival, declared that Americans should choose Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> over Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> repeating that “America deserves better!” Mr. <Entity>Walker</Entity> said he had always been clear that he would support any Republican against Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in the general election.
Fact Check: He was never an enthusiastic <Entity>Trump</Entity> fan. Mr. <Entity>Walker</Entity> endorsed Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> ahead of the Wisconsin primary, and later expressed disappointment that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would be the party’s standard-bearer. “It’s just sad in America that we have such poor choices right now,” Mr. <Entity>Walker</Entity> said then.

• Senator <Entity>Marco Rubio</Entity> of Florida, another former Trump rival, once called Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> a “con man,” and worse, as he fought a bitter campaign. But on Wednesday, Mr. <Entity>Rubio</Entity> appeared in a brief video to concede that “the time for fighting each other is over.” The video was hardly full of enthusiasm, but he did urge voters to choose Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> over Mrs. <Entity>Clinton.</Entity>
