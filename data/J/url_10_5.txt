In 2011, Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> helped write “Law and Government: An Introductory Study Course,” a textbook published by an evangelical Christian organization, according to Think Progress, a left-leaning website. A section of the book contains arguments against women running for office, but it was not personally written Mr. <Entity>Moore,</Entity> as the ad suggested.
“She’s not a warrior. She’s not a judge. She’s a woman. Created by God. Glorious in her place and in her conduct and in her role,” wrote the author of that section, who was identified by Think Progress by <Entity>William O. Einwechter.</Entity> “Nothing is said in Scripture that supports the notion that she is qualified or called to be a civil magistrate.”
Mr. <Entity>Moore’s</Entity> contributions to the legal course appear to be limited to a lecture detailing the fight over his display of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. His campaign has denied that he ever voiced opposition to women holding office.
