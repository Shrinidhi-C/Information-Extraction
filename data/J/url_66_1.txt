CLEVELAND — Yet another prominent person <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> hoped would appear at the Republican National Convention has rebuffed his invitation, the latest sign of disarray in the campaign’s planning of an event that starts in just three days.
<Entity>Rabbi Haskel Lookstein,</Entity> who heads the congregation that Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> daughter <Entity>Ivanka</Entity> and her husband, <Entity>Jared Kushner,</Entity> attend, told friends and congregants in an email on Friday that he had decided to back out because his appearance had become too politically charged. Faced with a backlash after the <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign released his name on a list of speakers — without specifying that he would deliver an invocation and not a speech — the rabbi said he had little choice.
“The whole matter turned from rabbinic to political, something which was never intended,” he said in the email. “In the interest of bringing our community together, I have asked to be relieved of my commitment to deliver the invocation.”
The <Entity>rabbi’s</Entity> withdrawal came less than 24 hours after the announcement from <Entity>Tim Tebow,</Entity> the onetime football star, that he also would not speak. Mr. <Entity>Tebow,</Entity> a Heisman Trophy winner and well-known religious conservative, was invited to appear at the convention as part of the lineup of athletes who will speak on Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> behalf.
But not just athletes are taking a pass. Both Senator <Entity>Rob Portman</Entity> and Gov. <Entity>John Kasich,</Entity> the two highest-ranking Republicans in Ohio, the state hosting the convention, have said they have no interest in speaking.
