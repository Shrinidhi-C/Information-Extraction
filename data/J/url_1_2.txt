Mr. <Entity>Romney</Entity> is popular in Utah, despite not having been born in the state and having spent much of his life elsewhere. (He and his wife, <Entity>Ann,</Entity> once kept a vacation home in Park City and in 2013, built a mansion in Holladay, a suburb of Salt Lake City.) He is one of the most prominent Mormons in American public life, a political advantage in a state where the population is about 60 percent Mormon and many civic and business leaders attend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Speaker <Entity>Paul D. Ryan,</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Romney’s</Entity> running mate in 2012, endorsed him in a statement on Friday, saying, “Our party and our country are always better off when <Entity>Mitt</Entity> is engaged.”
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> had pleaded with Senator <Entity>Hatch,</Entity> the longest-serving Senate Republican, to run for an eighth term, and Mr. <Entity>Romney’s</Entity> video underscored the potential for continuing clashes between himself and the president. The clip took several barely veiled shots at Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> policies and manner, as well as the ever-coarsening state of political discourse on Washington’s Capitol Hill.
“On Utah’s Capitol Hill,” he said, “people treat one another with respect.”
