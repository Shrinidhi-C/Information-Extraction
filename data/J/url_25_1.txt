President <Entity>Trump</Entity> declared his intention not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in a forceful speech on Friday. But the rationale he provided includes several misleading or incomplete statements about the terms of the deal, what he considers a violation of the agreement and Iran itself. Here is an assessment.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> gave an incomplete account of Iranian history. 
“Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said, referring to the Islamic Revolution. Clerics led by <Entity>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</Entity> overthrew the monarch that year and established an Islamic republic. His successor, <Entity>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,</Entity> is currently the supreme leader of Iran.
