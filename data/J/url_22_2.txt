But more to Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> point, nowhere does the bulletin contain the words “amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.” If Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is suggesting that the rise in crime is caused by Islamic terrorism, the report does not support that.
Two terrorists attacks, in London in June and in the northwest English city of Manchester in May, together killed 35 people and involved what the agency called 294 attempted murders. They represented 0.0006 percent of the total 5.2 million crimes during the period covered by the report. Over all, homicides actually decreased 2 percent.
“Violence against persons” — a broad category that includes terrorist attacks as one type of crime — totaled about 1.2 million, a 19 percent rise from the previous year. That was driven by increases in the subcategories of “violence without injury” (21 percent) and “stalking and harassment” (36 percent) as well as a smaller increase in “violence with injury” (10 percent), the statistical agency said.
The agency did not specifically break out terrorism as a subcategory.
Beyond the London and Manchester attacks, the police did not report the ethnicity or religion of the criminal offender, as they generally do not. “So there is no evidence that crimes by Islamic radicals have increased,” said <Entity>Brian Francis,</Entity> a statistician who specializes in criminology at Lancaster University.
