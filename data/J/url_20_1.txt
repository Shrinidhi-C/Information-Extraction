WASHINGTON — President Trump departs on his first trip to Asia on Friday weakened and scandal-scarred, ready to face off against newly empowered Chinese and Japanese leaders in a region increasingly determined to set its course without American direction.
The White House is framing the trip as a chance for Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> to showcase his budding personal relationships with President <Entity>Xi Jinping</Entity> of China and Prime Minister <Entity>Shinzo Abe</Entity> of Japan — a forceful world leader pressing his peers to negotiate fairer trade deals with the United States and to intensify the pressure on nuclear-armed North Korea.
But Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> erratic statecraft, compounded by the shadow of the Russia investigation, leaves him in a questionable position to extract concessions from Mr. Xi or even allies like Japan and South Korea. The South Koreans may actually draw closer to the Chinese after settling a dispute  this week over the rollout of an American antimissile system.
On the eve of the trip, White House aides also have a more basic concern: putting the 71-year-old president through a grueling 11-day, five-nation marathon that they originally conceived as two separate trips before Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> opted to do it all at once.
While Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is skipping a summit meeting of Southeast Asian leaders in the Philippines to head home a day earlier, it will still be the longest tour of Asia by any president since the elder George Bush in late 1991 — a trip that ended in Tokyo when Mr. <Entity>Bush,</Entity> tired and ill with the flu, collapsed after vomiting on the Japanese prime minister.
