In Vietnam, his aides said, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will articulate a new policy for Asia built on the concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region. The idea, they acknowledge, originated with the Japanese, who have been urging the United States to bond with three other maritime democracies — Japan, Australia, and India — to contain a rising China.
“This trip is a great opportunity to demonstrate America’s, and the Trump administration’s, commitment to the Indo-Pacific,” said the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, using what seemed likely to become a catchphrase for the Trump administration, much as the “Asia pivot” was for the Obama administration.
Japanese officials planted the Indo-Pacific idea with two American counterparts: <Entity>Brian H. Hook,</Entity> the State Department’s policy planning director, and <Entity>Matthew Pottinger,</Entity> the Asia director in the National Security Council. But it dates further back, to a 19th-century American naval officer and historian, <Entity>Alfred Thayer Mahan,</Entity> whose writings about maritime power have long been studied in Japan but who has only recently drawn attention in the White House.
The problem is, it is unclear that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is bringing any initiatives to Asia to further that vision. He withdrew the United States from the most obvious regional project, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He is pushing bilateral trade deals to replace that accord, but Japan and other Asian countries are reluctant to open negotiations, while South Korea is balking at Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> demand to renegotiate its existing trade agreement.
“When the region looks at <Entity>Trump,</Entity> they see uncertainty, they see unpredictability, they see a stepping back from key agreements like TPP,” said <Entity>Evan S. Medeiros,</Entity> a former senior adviser on Asia to President <Entity>Barack Obama.</Entity> “Asian policymakers have a really hard time understanding if he has a coherent strategy.”
And yet, Mr. <Entity>Medeiros</Entity> added, “Nobody in Asia can afford to alienate the American president, as unreliable and distasteful as he and his policies may be.”
