When Comcast sought to take over Time Warner Cable in 2014, Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> let the company’s executives know that his opposition was not just about his fear of higher prices for consumers. His opposition was also personal, as a New York Times article in April 2014 noted:
Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> was praised among Democrats in January for his questioning of <Entity>Betsy DeVos</Entity> during her confirmation hearing to be education secretary. The hearing was heated and partisan, and Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> had a memorable exchange with Ms. <Entity>DeVos</Entity> about education policy.
“I would like your views on the relative advantage of doing assessments and using them to measure proficiency or to measure growth,” he asked her.
During her response, Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> cut her off. “It surprises me that you don’t know this issue,” he replied.
On Nov. 16, <Entity>Leeann Tweeden</Entity> became the first woman to publicly accuse Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> of sexual harassment. Ms. <Entity>Tweeden,</Entity> a Los Angeles newscaster, said he kissed and groped her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour. He apologized almost immediately.
By Wednesday, several more women had come forward to accuse Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> of making unwanted sexual advances.
Mr. <Entity>Franken’s</Entity> support among his colleagues in the Senate crumbled this week. By Wednesday night, dozens of senators, including nearly all of the Democratic women in the Senate, were calling on him to resign. On Thursday morning, he spoke on the Senate floor, saying he would resign in the coming weeks, though he continued to dispute allegations against him.
While Mr. <Entity>Franken</Entity> had hoped for vindication from a congressional investigation, he said on Thursday that his remaining in the Senate would be a distraction.
“This decision is not about me. It’s about the people of Minnesota,” he said. “It’s become clear that I can’t both pursue the Ethics Committee process and at the same time remain an effective senator for them.”
