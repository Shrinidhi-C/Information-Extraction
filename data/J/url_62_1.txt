CLEVELAND — <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> on Wednesday praised the longtime corporate employee who assumed blame for two passages in <Entity>Melania Trump’s</Entity> convention speech that were lifted from <Entity>Michelle Obama’s</Entity> 2008 Democratic National Convention address, but he conceded that the public admission should have come a day earlier.
“I wanted to protect her — she’s been a person that’s been very good to me,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said in an interview with The New York Times, when asked if he had anything to add to the lengthy open letter from the employee, <Entity>Meredith McIver,</Entity> on the campaign’s website. “Absolutely. But it was getting to a point where it didn’t make sense — I mean, look at your story today.”
The Times on Tuesday evening identified Ms. <Entity>McIver,</Entity> who works for the Trump Organization and who has worked on some of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> books, as the person to whom Ms. <Entity>Trump</Entity> turned when she decided to shelve the bulk of a speech written for her by professional political speechwriters hired by her son-in-law, <Entity>Jared Kushner.</Entity>
But the company and the campaign declined to elaborate on Ms. <Entity>McIver’s</Entity> role on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, she said that early in the writing process she had been read those passages by Ms. <Entity>Trump</Entity> as examples of text that the candidate’s wife liked. Those passages were then incorporated, with some changed language, into Ms. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> address, sparking a controversy that overshadowed the Monday night speech.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> thanked Ms. <Entity>McIver</Entity> for coming forward.
