<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> tried out several lines of attack against <Entity>Hillary Clinton,</Entity> at one point calling her “unfit to be president,” as he delivered an otherwise noticeably restrained speech to an audience of evangelical activists here Friday.
Appearing before the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> promised to “uphold the sanctity and dignity of life” and to “restore respect for people of faith.”
But he also used the opportunity to press his case against Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> portraying her as arrogant, attacking her economic policies and willingness to admit Syrian refugees into the country and questioning her judgment as secretary of state.
“She’ll appoint radical judges who will legislate from the bench, overriding Congress, and I’ll tell you, the will of the people will mean nothing — nothing,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said. “She will undermine the wages of working people with uncontrolled immigration, creating poverty and income insecurity. <Entity>Hillary Clinton’s</Entity> Wall Street agenda will crush working families. She’ll put bureaucrats, not parents, in charge of our lives, and our children’s education.”
Referring to Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> call for Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> to take in 65,000 Syrian refugees, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> also challenged her to instead “replace her support for increased refugee admissions” with “a new jobs program for our inner cities.”
A few young protesters interrupted Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> remarks, shouting “Dump Trump” and other slogans. After they were muscled out by security guards, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> called them “professional agitators” who were “sent in by the other party — believe me.”
