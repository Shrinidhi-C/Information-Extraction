One is simply that, from a stock market standpoint, Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> had fortuitous timing. The market and the economy were already in such bad shape by the time he arrived in office that any signs of recovery were likely to result in a market rebound. Stocks did relatively well during much of <Entity>Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s</Entity> tenure, for example, partly because they had done so badly during <Entity>Herbert Hoover’s</Entity> presidency at the start of the Great Depression.
The second crucial factor is that the Federal Reserve, which the president does not control directly, embarked on an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy, starting even before Mr. Obama took office. On Dec. 16, 2008, for example, one month after the presidential election, the Fed brought short-term rates sharply lower, close to zero.
Fed interest rate policy may be the single most important factor behind the stock market boom. And even if Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> does not control the Fed, he did reappoint <Entity>Ben S. Bernanke</Entity> as Fed chairman in August 2009. In October 2013, the president appointed <Entity>Janet L. Yellen</Entity> as Mr. <Entity>Bernanke’s</Entity> successor. Under both, the Fed has held interest rates very low, which is helping to buoy the stock market and may be affecting the presidential election, as <Entity>Ned Davis</Entity> Research suggests in a recent note to clients.
The financial market research firm’s survey of presidential elections and the stock market since 1900 concludes that (even though voters tend to tire of two-term presidents and their political parties) the kind of market we’ve seen this year is, if anything, auspicious for the incumbent Democratic Party. “The stock market action so far this year is very much aligning up to support an incumbent party retaining the White House,” said <Entity>Ed Clissold,</Entity> chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research and a co-author of the note.
The economy, which isn’t strong, is at least not in recession, he said, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expansionary, while fiscal policy is looser than it was during Mr. <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> first term, which was bedeviled by the “fiscal cliff” budget impasse. He also cited this year’s stock market pattern, which includes a correction — a decline of a little more than 10 percent — that ended in February, along with a smart recovery. All of that helps to tilt the odds in favor of an incumbent party victory, he said. A major market decline before the election could shift matters, however.
This kind of tea leaf reading implies that the stock market is affecting the country’s mood and political alignment, even if it’s not being widely recognized. Investors may not give the president any credit for their portfolio returns. But the numbers are straightforward enough, and for those fortunate enough to hold stock, they are heartening: It’s been a splendid market.
