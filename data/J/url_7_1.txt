WASHINGTON — “Chain migration,” or family-based immigration, has emerged as a key point of negotiations — and the subject of heated, inaccurate exchanges — as Congress tries to reach a deal on giving legal status to undocumented migrants who arrived in the United States as children, known as Dreamers.
President <Entity>Trump</Entity> has argued that chain migration has benefited terrorists, while Republican hard-liners say it could reward those who have broken immigration laws. Some Democrats have inaccurately characterized attempts to limit what they call “family reunification.”
Here’s an assessment.
Under current immigration law, American green card holders can sponsor their spouses and unmarried children for permanent residence. Additionally, United States citizens can petition for residence for their parents, siblings and married adult children.
It is implausible that <Entity>Sayfullo Saipov,</Entity> the suspect in the attack in October in Manhattan, enabled 22 to 24 people to immigrate to the United States. He immigrated to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, married another Uzbek immigrant in 2013 in Ohio and fathered three children in the United States. And as a green card holder, he would not have been able sponsor any extended family.
<Entity>Mark Krikorian</Entity> of the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration, said he was unsure what Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> was referring to in Mr. <Entity>Saipov’s</Entity> case. But “it’s obviously not the relatives” sponsored by the attacker, Mr. <Entity>Krikorian</Entity> said, given the waiting period and limits to family-based immigration.
