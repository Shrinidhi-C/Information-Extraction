Under a law passed in 1995, the president has to sign a national security waiver every six months to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv, and that deadline expired Monday. The White House said Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> took no action on Monday, but would announce his decision soon.
“The president has been clear on this issue from the get-go that it’s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” the deputy press secretary, <Entity>Hogan Gidley,</Entity> told reporters.
Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> officials said, is expected to sign the waiver but couple it with recognition of Jerusalem as the capital — a move that the White House hopes will mollify evangelicals and other staunchly pro-Israel supporters.
Mr. <Entity>Macron’s</Entity> objections are hardly a surprise. European leaders agree that Jerusalem’s status should be decided in a peace negotiation. France nourishes its own ambitions as a peacemaker: It played host to a Middle East peace conference shortly before Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> took office.
One influential country that has not weighed in on the possible shift in American policy is Saudi Arabia. That is surprising given that Jerusalem is home to the Aqsa Mosque, and that the Saudi king holds the title of custodian of Islam’s two other holiest mosques, in Mecca and Medina.
“The silence from Riyadh is deafening,” said <Entity>Aaron David Miller,</Entity> a former Middle East peace negotiator now at the Wilson Center. “Either they know the president won’t issue a statement or they’re privy to some initiative, of which the Jerusalem gambit is a part.”
