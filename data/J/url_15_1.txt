WASHINGTON — At a Wednesday afternoon rally in Missouri, President <Entity>Trump</Entity> played up what he called the “biggest tax cuts in history” and boasted about economic growth “in a nonbraggadocious way.”
“In fact, they’re going to say <Entity>Trump</Entity> is the opposite of an exaggerator,” he said of his rosy projections, in a speech full of exaggerations and falsehoods. Here’s an assessment.
President <Entity>Ronald Reagan,</Entity> who enacted a major tax cut in 1981 and lowered tax rates again in 1986, was hardly the last president to have done so. President <Entity>Bill Clinton</Entity> signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President <Entity>George W. Bush</Entity> enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under President <Entity>Barack Obama</Entity> included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012.
