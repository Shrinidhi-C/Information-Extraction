The claim appeared to refer to concerns that the private server Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> used as secretary of state may have been more vulnerable to being hacked by foreign adversaries than the State Department’s email system. (Although the emails were supposed to contain only unclassified information, the department has retroactively withheld some of their contents as classified when reviewing them for release in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.)
But Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> offered no backup for his claim that the private server was used to hide “corrupt dealings.”
Noting that President <Entity>Obama</Entity> had officially endorsed Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> on Thursday, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> added, “First time ever, by the way, a president of the United States endorsed somebody under criminal investigation.”
But that assertion also goes beyond the known facts. The FBI is investigating Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> use of a private server, but agents have not yet interviewed her and it is not clear if she herself is a target of a criminal inquiry.
