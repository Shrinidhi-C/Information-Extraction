WASHINGTON — As a freewheeling candidate on the campaign trail, <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> amassed a long list of promises.
Some became rallying cries and signature to his candidacy (“build the wall”). Others reflected conventional Republican policy wishes (repealing the Affordable Care Act). And then there were the unorthodox pledges about how he would comport himself in office, a few probably improvised (“I will never be in a bicycle race”) or doomed from the start (“We won’t tweet anymore — not presidential”).
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has described his first year in office as “a year of real change.” Here’s an assessment on his progress on promises about his approach to the presidency.
Of the six measures Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> outlined in his 100-day action plan “to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington,” he has kept his word on two, imposing lifetime bans on White House officials lobbying for foreign governments and requiring the elimination of two regulations for every one enacted.
He has also partially fulfilled two pledges. His promised hiring freeze on federal employees was enacted in January 2017, but lifted in April.
Additionally, he took a narrowly tailored approach to his pledge to bar White House and congressional officials from lobbying for five years after leaving office. Rather than a blanket restriction, his executive order specified that White House officials could not lobby the agencies they served, and did not cover congressional officials.
But he has not taken any action on two other promises. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has yet to propose term limits for members of Congress or enact a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.
