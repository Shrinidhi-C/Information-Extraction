You might recognize the image as a coded letter the Zodiac killer once sent. This does not, any reasonable person would conclude, offer definitive proof that Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> is the Zodiac killer, who was blamed for at least five murders in the San Francisco Bay Area and has never been identified.
But it did make for a suitable distraction on Wednesday, as people on Twitter erupted at what appeared to be Mr. <Entity>Cruz’s</Entity> first acknowledgment of the long-running joke.
Did the one-time presidential candidate score a few points for being in on the joke? Did he ruin what was once a fun joke?
Others — surely including those hearing about it for the first time through this article — were all sorts of baffled. Why did he tweet the Zodiac note? Why do people say he’s the Zodiac killer? Does anything make sense anymore?
No, it most certainly does not. But to make sense of Wednesday’s events — which do not matter in any significant way, as none of this matters in a cosmic sense — we begin at the origin of the meme.
Like many other memes and jokes, there’s no real reason for it. According to the meme-tracking website Know Your Meme, joking references to Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> being the Zodiac killer date to at least 2013.
