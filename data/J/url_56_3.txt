Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> flattery of foreign dictators, his mixed business record and his provocative proposals to build a wall and ban Muslim migration have given Democrats lot of fodder for attack ads and convention speeches this year.
For those who competed against Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> during the Republican nominating contest, and warned of his vulnerabilities, the skewering from Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> brought a sense of wistfulness. <Entity>Tim Miller,</Entity> a former spokesman for <Entity>Jeb Bush,</Entity> who is a fierce critic of Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> said Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> showed why the Republican nominee has been such a gift to Democrats.
Of course, many Republicans panned the speech as more divisiveness from a president who they think accomplished little during his nearly eight years in office. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said on Thursday morning that “President <Entity>Obama</Entity> spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist.”
Others, such as a former spokesman for Senator <Entity>Marco Rubio,</Entity> could not help but express admiration for the smart stagecraft employed by the Democrats. The outreach to disaffected Republicans was both overt and subtle.
