“Everyone plays their games, it doesn’t bother me,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said, claiming Pastor <Entity>Timmons</Entity> was shaking when she came up to him.
He added: “She was so nervous, she was like a nervous mess. I figured something was up.”
Some conservatives defended Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> on Thursday, pointing to a Facebook post in which she wrote that the visit was an opportunity to educate Republican candidate as evidence that she was planning to embarrass him. While that post does not appear on her Facebook page, Pastor <Entity>Timmons</Entity> did address the controversy there on Wednesday night.
“Had he stuck to what his camp claimed he came to do, we would not have had a problem!” she wrote.
