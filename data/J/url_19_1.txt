WASHINGTON — President Trump’s labeling of Sunday’s church shooting in Texas as “a mental health problem” reflected a broad pattern in his responses to deadly mass attacks in the United States.
In some cases, Mr. Trump has aggressively denounced “radical Islamic terrorism” and demanded a clampdown on immigration. But in others, he has lamented the inevitability of tragedy and focused on the attackers’ psychological problems.
“This isn’t a guns situation,” the president said at a news conference in Tokyo on Monday. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”
Here’s a look back at what Mr. Trump has said in the wake of attacks since he announced his candidacy in 2015.
