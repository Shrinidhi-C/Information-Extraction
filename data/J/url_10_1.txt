WASHINGTON — At a Friday night rally, President <Entity>Trump</Entity> urged supporters to vote for <Entity>Roy S. Moore,</Entity> the Republican candidate in an Alabama Senate race who has been accused of sexual misconduct.
“How many are people here from the great state of Alabama?” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> asked at the rally in Pensacola, Fla., about a half-hour drive from the Alabama border. “Did you see what happened today, you know, the yearbook?”
He was referring to a high school yearbook that one of Mr. <Entity>Moore’s</Entity> accusers said he signed in 1977. Whether that happened is only one of the disputes over the facts in a Senate campaign filled with inaccurate claims. As the election on Tuesday approaches, here’s an assessment.
<Entity>Beverly Young Nelson</Entity> told reporters last month that Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager after her shift had ended at the Olde Hickory House, a now-defunct restaurant in Gadsden, Ala. She presented a yearbook that she said had been signed by Mr. <Entity>Moore.</Entity>
On Friday, Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> shared a Breitbart News article on his Facebook page with the headline: “Bombshell: <Entity>Roy Moore</Entity> Accuser <Entity>Beverly Nelson</Entity> Admits She Forged Yearbook.” On Twitter, Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> said Ms. <Entity>Nelson</Entity> had been accused of lying by her then-boyfriend, her stepson and employees and customers of the restaurant. “Now she herself admits to lying,” he wrote.
These claims are not entirely accurate. Ms. <Entity>Nelson,</Entity> in a Friday interview with ABC News, said Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> had signed the yearbook and she added notes detailing the date and location. She did not admit to forging his signature.
