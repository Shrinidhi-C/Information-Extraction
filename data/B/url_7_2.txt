Theoretically, had Mr. <Entity>Saipov</Entity> obtained citizenship, he could have petitioned for his parents and three sisters (whose spouses and children under 21 could have also immigrated with them) to gain residency. Even in this hypothetical, it would have taken more than a decade for Mr. <Entity>Saipov</Entity> to sponsor 22 to 24 relatives.
Because there are numerical limits for family-based immigration each year, there is a long queue for visas. (As of Nov. 1, more than 3.9 million people were waiting in line.) After a petition is filed and approved, would-be immigrants are essentially handed a ticket number called the “priority date” and can only apply for a green card when the State Department calls their number.
The waiting period can last a few months to more than two decades, depending on the country of origin, the sponsor’s immigration status and the applicant’s relationship to their sponsor. In January, for example, Uzbek immigrants sponsored by American-citizen siblings could begin to apply for a green card if their priority date was before June 22, 2004, a waiting period of 13.5 years.
Senator <Entity>Tom Cotton</Entity> of Arkansas argued on the Senate floor on Monday that immigrants who came to the United States as children could petition their relatives for green cards, including “the very parents who brought them here, in violation of the law, in the first place.” Representative <Entity>Dave Brat</Entity> of Virginia, in an interview this month on Bloomberg, estimated that giving legal status to some 800,000 people who entered the country as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy could lead to an influx of “three to four million” potential relatives when “multiplied by chain migration.”
A spokeswoman for Mr. <Entity>Brat</Entity> said the congressman based his estimate on research showing one immigrant could lead to an average of an additional 4.2 people coming to the United States, with higher numbers from South and Central America. That figure comes from a 2008 book on chain migration by <Entity>Bin Yu,</Entity> a professor at Rhode Island College.
In an interview, Mr. <Entity>Yu</Entity> said he believed chain migration also included the American-born children of immigrants, whom he included in his 4.2 immigration multiplier average. It should be noted, however, that people who are born in the United States are generally given American citizenship. By confining so-called chain migration to foreign relatives, Mr. <Entity>Yu’s</Entity> research shows that one immigrant could result in the sponsorship of an average of 2.1 additional people.
