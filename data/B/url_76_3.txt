Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> speech Friday came as he is battling to regain his footing after weeks of missteps, none more damaging than his questioning whether a federal judge could preside fairly over a case against Trump University because the judge is of Mexican heritage.
With party leaders expressing outrage and voicing doubts that he can unify Republicans and defeat Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in November, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> noticeably curbed his impulsiveness Tuesday night, promising in a prepared speech not to let his supporters down.
Still, in a Bloomberg Politics podcast published Friday morning, Senate Majority Leader <Entity>Mitch McConnell</Entity> raised the possibility of rescinding his endorsement if Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> did not “change directions.” Alluding to what he called Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> “obvious shortcomings,” Mr. <Entity>McConnell</Entity> said, “It’s pretty obvious he doesn’t know a lot about the issues.”
Before the Faith and Freedom Coalition Friday afternoon, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> again stuck mainly to a script, reading from teleprompter screens. But he still ad-libbed in his characteristically clipped syntax.
“We want to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life, marriage and family as the building block of happiness and success,” he said. “And by the way, I know many, many very successful people. The happiest people are the people that have had great religious feel and that — incredible marriage, children. It’s more important than the money, folks. Believe me.”
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> — who has been married three times — does not hew to traditional conservative orthodoxy. He previously supported abortion rights, and he said earlier this year that Planned Parenthood has done “some very good work” for millions of women. And in response to North Carolina’s controversial new bathroom law, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said that transgender people should be able to use whatever bathroom where they feel most comfortable.
But he nonetheless won the early endorsement of leaders like <Entity>Jerry Falwell Jr.,</Entity> president of Liberty University, and successfully wooed evangelical voters during the primary, exit polls showed.
<Entity>Hogan Gidley,</Entity> a former aide to Gov. <Entity>Mike Huckabee</Entity> of Arkansas, said that while evangelicals “would love to have a true evangelical in the White House,” they understood that Republicans required a broader coalition to win in November.
“Republicans cannot win without getting evangelicals, and they can’t win only getting evangelicals,” Mr. <Entity>Gidley</Entity> said. “They have to expand the voter universe and so far, <Entity>Trump</Entity> has done an amazing job with that.”
