PHILADELPHIA — For years President <Entity>Obama</Entity> has been a boogeyman to Republicans, uniting them in opposition to a Democrat they feel has taken the country in the wrong direction and failed to lead.
But after a stirring speech at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, many conservatives who cannot bring themselves to support their party’s nominee, <Entity>Donald J. Trump,</Entity> credited the president’s speech for being a strong one and expressed regret that Democrats appeared to be appropriating themes that were once the bedrock of their party.
<Entity>Rich Lowry,</Entity> editor of the conservative National Review magazine, called the speech “very effective” and noted that the Democrats were using classic Republicanisms.
