<Entity>Jeb Bush,</Entity> the former Florida governor vanquished by Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> during the Republican primary process, sent Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> a congratulatory message on Twitter.
Dozens of Republican elected officials resisted Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> rise to power, including some who revoked their endorsements in the heat of the general election. Senators like <Entity>Lindsey Graham</Entity> of South Carolina and <Entity>John McCain</Entity> of Arizona declared Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> unfit to lead, while ideological conservatives like <Entity>Ben Sasse</Entity> of Nebraska and <Entity>Mike Lee</Entity> of Utah warned of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> indifference to the limits of government power.
These <Entity>Trump</Entity> critics on the right now face a wrenching political choice: to defer to him as the country’s new leader, or to take up a quasi-oppositional role against a Republican as he assembles his administration. Since Republicans kept control of the House and Senate, dissenters within Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> party may hold outsize influence over exactly how he can govern as president.
Mr. <Entity>Graham</Entity> took a reserved approach in his statement on the election on Tuesday, saying that he would aim to help Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> govern — within the bounds of a fairly conventional Republican agenda.
