Ms. <Entity>Edwards</Entity> is right that most of the benefits of the tax law signed by Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> in December will accrue to the wealthy and very wealthy. But middle class and low-income Americans will get a tax cut too.
The Tax Policy Center, a research group, found that taxes will be reduced for every income group this year. And the 40th to 60th percentile of American households by income will receive an average tax cut of about $900 through 2025. Personal tax cuts expire after that point, though Congress may choose to extend them.
But the highest income brackets do stand to benefit the most. In 2018, the top 1 percent of earners will receive about 20.5 percent of the benefits, increasing to 25.3 percent in 2025 and 83 percent in 2027.
The United States had never formally ratified the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 other nations before Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> abandoned the trade deal.

And Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has not yet proposed withdrawing from any of the other ongoing trade deals the United States has with 19 other countries.
