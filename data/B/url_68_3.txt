In his remarks, Mr. <Entity>Miranda,</Entity> his once-long Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> without saying his name.
“Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who’s building bridges?” asked Mr. <Entity>Miranda,</Entity> whose Tony Award-winning show is, after all, about an immigrant.
He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents.
“Right now,” he said, “you’re going to hear from the 45th president.”
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. <Entity>Miranda</Entity> and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando.
Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> lingered on the message of the show’s final number, “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” and the meaning of legacy.
“It really is true that it matters whose stories are told,” she said, “and heard.”
