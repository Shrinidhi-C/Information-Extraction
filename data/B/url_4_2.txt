Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> a billionaire, vowed to not take “even one dollar” of his $400,000 annual salary as president, following in the footsteps of presidents like <Entity>John F. Kennedy</Entity> and <Entity>Herbert Hoover.</Entity>
So far, he has kept his word, donating his paychecks to the National Park Service in the first quarter of 2017, the Education Department in the second, and then the Health and Human Services Department in the third to help combat the opioid crisis. The White House would not answer questions about what Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would do with his paychecks in the fourth quarter of last year.
As the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> repeatedly vowed to do so once his Internal Revenue Service audit was complete.
The pledge was flawed to begin with. Though tax lawyers may advise against it, the I.R.S. has said that an audit does not prevent individuals from releasing their own tax information. The Trump campaign also released a letter from his lawyers that said Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> tax returns, before 2009, were “closed administratively” — or no longer subject to an audit.
But in May, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> reneged on the promise in an interview with The Economist, moving the release date to “after I’m out of office.”
After incessantly chastising President <Entity>Barack Obama</Entity> for golfing, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> promised during the campaign that “because I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf.” He later made an exception for “leaders of countries and people who can help us.”
Yet Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has played more golf than his predecessor, according to independent trackers.
