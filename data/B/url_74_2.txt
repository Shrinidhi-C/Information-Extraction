The N.R.A. used the Sunday morning political shows to criticize, and even to mock, Democratic efforts to pass new gun control laws after the Orlando shooting.
<Entity>Wayne LaPierre,</Entity> the group’s executive vice president, said on “Face the Nation” that legislation was effectively useless at preventing terrorist attacks.
“These bad guys we’re facing, they don’t say: ‘Oh gosh, they passed a law. Oh gosh, I don’t think I could do it,’” Mr. <Entity>LaPierre</Entity> said.
Democrats made their own push for expanded gun control — which the Senate is to take up Monday — and more broadly, for a grass-roots effort to take on opponents of stricter gun control.
Senator <Entity>Chris Murphy,</Entity> Democrat of Connecticut, who led a 15-hour marathon of speeches on the Senate floor that ended early Thursday, said on ABC that “the only way that you win this issue is by building a political infrastructure around the country that rivals that of the gun lobby.” Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> presumptive Democratic opponent, <Entity>Hillary Clinton,</Entity> expressed her support for the effort, writing “Stand strong @ChrisMurphyCT” on Twitter.
Profiling has been an occasional theme of the <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign. In addition to his most recent comments, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has discussed increased surveillance of Muslims and mosques, and has said that he would consider registering Muslims in a special database or requiring that they carry cards that identify them as Muslim.
