<Entity>Austin Karp,</Entity> the assistant managing editor of SportsBusiness Daily, said it was too early to know what football’s viewership trends would look like this year. He noted that there were “lots of moving parts.” For instance, he said that the first week of games was “heavily affected by Hurricane Irma TV coverage, leading to a drop in ratings for the N.F.L. to start the season.”
There’s a larger trend of a decline in linear television viewership to factor in as well. Ratings have been declining for most broadcasters for years now. Live sports coverage has somewhat bucked this trend. And among American audiences, football still commands more viewers than just about any other sport. Mr. <Entity>Karp</Entity> noted that both NBC’s Sunday Night Football, which declined by 15 percent from last year, and CBS’s Sunday games both averaged more viewers than the last 11 iterations of the Daytona 500 for Nascar, which Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> notably praised and contrasted with the N.F.L. on Twitter.
