The <Entity>Trump</Entity> administration has been more tight-lipped about the Niger attack than the <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration was about Benghazi, though some of the <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration’s initial claims turned out to be incomplete.

Christopher Stevens</Entity> and three other Americans. <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration officials initially rejected the notion of a premeditated terrorist attack and, in the immediate days that followed, made repeated references to an anti-Muslim video as causing the unrest — a rationale soon revealed to be not entirely accurate.
