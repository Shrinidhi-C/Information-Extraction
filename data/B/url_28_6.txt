Mr. <Entity>Bannon</Entity> declined to discuss the details of his meetings. But it is not hard, given his views and recent proximity to Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> to guess why foreign leaders would seek him out. He still talks to the president from time to time, even if the White House plays down the frequency of those contacts.
More than his value as a conduit, Mr. <Entity>Bannon</Entity> is viewed as the intellectual force behind the political movement that carried Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> to the White House. Now back in his old job at the far-right media outlet, Breitbart News Network, he is pushing his agenda and punishing those who he believes are traitors to the cause.
