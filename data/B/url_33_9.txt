“Please stop saying that <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> firing of <Entity>Comey</Entity> is <Entity>Nixon’s</Entity> Saturday Night Massacre all over again. At that time back in 1973, there had already been an independent Watergate special prosecutor in place for months, who had made great strides toward bringing the President to justice.
And the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both resigned in protest over <Entity>Nixon’s</Entity> decision, while Sessions and Rosenstein are complicit in <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> firing.
Our current predicament is not the Saturday Night Massacre 2.0. It is much more bleak.”

“This is not ‘The Apprentice.’ This is a man who has given decades to the service of our country. What does it say to others who serve?”
