For Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the difference between trailing Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> by a little and trailing by a lot has often been the strength of his backing from other Republicans. Campaigning on a set of themes unlike any other recent Republican nominee, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has occasionally fallen behind by landslide margins when conservative-leaning voters shifted away from him.
Shunned by many party leaders, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is plainly still working to rally Republicans: His running mate, Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence</Entity> of Indiana, has been publicly pleading with partisans to “come home” to their presidential ticket. Mr. <Entity>Pence</Entity> is campaigning in Arizona on Wednesday, a traditionally conservative state where Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has struggled.
Republican support alone cannot make Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> the next president. But only by improving and cementing his support on the right can Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> get close to Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> on Election Day and leave a lasting mark on the party he has helmed since spring.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> are largely battling over a handful of big swing states: Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. But both are also traveling outside the traditional map this week and throwing money at television commercials in unexpected places.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was in Arizona on Wednesday, seeking to exploit Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> weakness with Hispanic voters and suburban whites. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> visited Michigan and New Mexico earlier in the week, trying to find new paths to victory in the Electoral College, where Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> holds a considerable advantage. But he returned to conventional turf on Wednesday, with three stops in Florida on his schedule.
While Democrats express confidence that they can repel Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> forays, they are leaving little to chance: Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> now plans to visit Detroit on Friday. If Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> finds his path forward continually frustrated, could he add another long-shot state or two?
