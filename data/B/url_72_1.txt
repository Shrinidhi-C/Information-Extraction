A man arrested at a <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> rally in Las Vegas on Saturday told the authorities that he had intended to kill Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> according to a complaint filed Monday in United States District Court in Nevada.
The man, <Entity>Michael Steven Sandford,</Entity> was arrested after trying to grab an officer’s gun from her holster, the complaint said, and had lingered near the officer, telling her he wanted Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> autograph.
In an interview after his arrest, the complaint says, Mr. <Entity>Sandford</Entity> told the authorities that he “made a conscious effort to come to Las Vegas to kill Trump,” and that he had been “planning to attempt to kill <Entity>Trump</Entity> for about a year.” He also said that he expected to be killed by law enforcement personnel during his attempt on Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> life.
Mr. <Entity>Sandford</Entity> said that the day before the rally, which was held at the Treasure Island casino, that he visited a nearby gun range to “learn how to shoot a gun” and that it was his first time using a weapon. He said he chose the specific officer because he noticed that her holster was in an “unlocked position.”
