Holocaust references can be something of a third rail in American politics. Last year Republicans called on <Entity>Mike Huckabee</Entity> to apologize when he said that President <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> Iran policy would “take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven.”
The gas chamber comment was quickly picked up in the Israeli press and critics of Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> such as the independent presidential candidate <Entity>Evan McMullin,</Entity> who said that the statement was revealing.
“An unsurprising Nazi reference from the ‘alt-right’ movement’s presidential campaign,” Mr. <Entity>McMullin</Entity> wrote in a post on Twitter. “This is the real <Entity>Trump.”</Entity>
The Anti-Defamation League also scolded <Entity>Donald Trump Jr.</Entity> for showing a lack of sensitivity about the Holocaust.
