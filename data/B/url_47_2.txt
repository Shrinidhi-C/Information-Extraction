Monday was also another milestone — three weeks until the first presidential debate between two nominees from New York, to be held on Long Island.
The campaign trail will get busier in the prelude to the debates and to the voting on Nov. 8. On Tuesday, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> will hold a rally in Tampa, Fla., while her running mate, Senator <Entity>Tim Kaine</Entity> of Virginia, will give a national security speech in Wilmington, N.C.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will hold rallies in Virginia Beach and Greenville, N.C., and Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence</Entity> of Indiana, his running mate, will make two stops in Missouri.
The trips that Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> made to Ohio, a crucial battleground state, highlighted the disparities between them. Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> team and the Democrats have a well-established ground game in the state, while Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> who is at odds with the state’s Republican governor, <Entity>John R. Kasich,</Entity> lags far behind in organization.
Turnout efforts and a focus on absentee ballot programs could help determine the outcome of close contests in crucial states. And with two months left, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has a wide gap to close.
