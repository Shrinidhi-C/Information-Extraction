MANILA — President <Entity>Trump</Entity> found out about the great U.C.L.A.-China basketball episode of 2017 when members of his staff saw it on CNN just before Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> dinner with the president of China in Beijing last week.
They learned that three American college basketball players — representing a storied sports program visiting China for an early-season game sponsored by one of China’s largest companies — had been arrested on Nov. 8, accused of stealing designer sunglasses at a high-end shopping mall.
The alleged offense was hardly life or death. But what had begun as a simple accusation of celebrity shoplifting threatened to escalate into a full-blown international incident just as Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> arrived in China on a 12-day mission through Asia, his first foreign trip to the region.
“These are law and order guys; they have pretty swift justice,” <Entity>John Kelly,</Entity> the president’s chief of staff, said of the Chinese authorities in a telephone interview later. “An awful lot of American kids don’t realize that the kinds of things that in United States society we tolerate with a slap on the wrist, a lot of countries they take very seriously.”
In addition to Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the weeklong diplomatic drama involved the players themselves, who remained detained at their hotel in the provincial city of Hangzhou for most of the week; U.C.L.A., an elite American university with an international reputation; and the Chinese retail giant Alibaba, which sponsored the team’s visit.
