Russia and Niger did agree in August to “interact in the war on terror, exchange information on military and political issues and the issues of strengthening international security,” according to Tass, Russia’s news agency. But the United States’ presence in Niger predates this agreement by years. In 2013, President <Entity>Barack Obama</Entity> announced that American troops had been sent to Niger’s capital, Niamey, to set up a new drone base.
An image widely shared on Facebook and Twitter states: <Entity>“Trump</Entity> arbitrarily bans Chad with travel ban. Chad withdraws troops fighting ISIS from Niger. ISIS promptly returns to Niger when Chad leaves. Four Green Berets die as a direct result.” But the facts do not support this.
Two of the four soldiers killed in the ambush — Staff Sgt. <Entity>Dustin M. Wright</Entity> and Staff Sgt. <Entity>Bryan C. Black</Entity> — were Green Berets. The two others were Staff Sgt. <Entity>Jeremiah W. Johnson</Entity> and Sgt. <Entity>La David T. Johnson.</Entity>
