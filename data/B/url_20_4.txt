He said Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> relationship with Mr. <Entity>Xi,</Entity> nurtured in their meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April, would help the president. But analysts noted that Mr. <Entity>Xi,</Entity> who emerged from the recent Communist Party congress as perhaps the most powerful Chinese leader since <Entity>Deng Xiaoping,</Entity> has less of a reason to avoid friction with Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> — either over North Korea or trade, where Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> protectionist instincts could antagonize Beijing.
Mr. <Entity>Xi</Entity> demonstrated his self-confidence by reaching out to South Korea to settle the dispute over the South’s deployment of an American antimissile system on the Korean Peninsula. At one level, that underscored China’s inability to drive a wedge between the United States and its ally.
But it also complicated Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> efforts to build a coalition to pressure North Korea, since it more closely aligns the South Korean president, <Entity>Moon Jae-in,</Entity> who favors diplomatic engagement over threats of military force, with China, which also favors diplomacy.
Beyond that, the rapprochement illustrated that Asian nations are finding it harder to resist China’s embrace, especially at a time when the United States seems unpredictable and unreliable.
