In other cases, detained Americans have become geopolitical pawns, often trapped in a kind of legal limbo for months or years.
And in a few instances, the outcome has been horrific, as in the case of <Entity>Otto Warmbier,</Entity> an American student in North Korea who was tortured and later died after being detained on charges that he tried to steal a poster from his hotel.
But just as concern deepened about the fate of the three young athletes in China, their detention abruptly ended, aided, it seems, by Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> direct intervention with the country’s president, <Entity>Xi Jinping.</Entity> On Tuesday, the three players, including the star freshman <Entity>LiAngelo Ball,</Entity> the brother of the N.B.A. rookie <Entity>Lonzo Ball,</Entity> were allowed to leave their hotel and board a flight back to California.
“The three U.C.L.A. men’s basketball student-athletes involved in the incident with authorities in Hangzhou, China, are on a flight back home to Los Angeles,” the Pacific-12, the athletics conference to which the university belongs, said in a statement, adding that “the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Chinese authorities.”
“We want to thank the president, the White House and the U.S. State Department for their efforts towards resolution,” the statement said.
