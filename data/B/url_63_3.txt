Instead, on the 47th anniversary of <Entity>Neil Armstrong’s</Entity> walk on the moon, Ms. <Entity>Collins</Entity> offered a gauzy appeal for America to be a “nation of explorers.” One thing she never said: Support Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> for president.

“Hispanics believe what Republicans believe,” he declared, listing off “religious liberty,” support of the Second Amendment and free speech as key examples.
