“Now more than ever, we must put all our support behind <Entity>Hillary Clinton,”</Entity> <Entity>Stephanie Schriock,</Entity> president of <Entity>Emily’s</Entity> List, a “super PAC” that supports female candidates.
On Friday, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was doing her best to appear to be the anti-Trump. In Orlando, Fla., she met with the families of the victims of the shooting last month at Pulse, a gay nightclub, and sat down for a round-table discussion with local officials and emergency medical workers. Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> also paid her respects at a memorial for the 49 people who were killed in the attack.
“We need to acknowledge and be very clear who this attack targeted — the Latino, L.G.B.T. community was the target that was most severely impacted by this terrible attack,” Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> said at the intimate event at the Holden Heights Community Center.
After Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> spoke for 75 minutes on Thursday night, often growing animated and raising his voice, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> she spoke little at her event on Friday, mostly listening and nodding as a panel of seven participants talked about violence against transgender women of color, discrimination against Muslims, gun control and other issues affecting their community.
“I want to thank you for not politicizing this and for waiting until we were ready,” said Patty Sheehan, an Orlando city commissioner.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> then, perhaps inadvertently, used her campaign slogan, Stronger Together, to portray Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> as divisive.
“We are stronger together,” she told the panelists.
