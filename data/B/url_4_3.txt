The White House has repeatedly declined to comment on Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> golf partners. While he played a round with Prime Minister <Entity>Shinzo Abe</Entity> of Japan in February, he was also accompanied by professional golf players, not world leaders, for at least four games.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> pledged to “not be a president who took vacations” and blasted Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> for his own personal trips.
In a 2012 report, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the president is “always on duty” and that his vacations are considered official travel.
Over the past year, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has taken some R&R. He spent 17 days in at his golf club in New Jersey, which the White House labeled a “working vacation,” and voyaged to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a holiday respite that included presidential duties.
It is unclear how those trips were different from the vacations that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> criticized Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> for taking. The former president, for example, spent holidays in Hawaii — a frequent talking point of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> — where he played golf, received intelligence briefings and visited troops.
Over all, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has visited a Trump property one out of every three days since taking office.
