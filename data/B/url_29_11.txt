While Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> defended the tactics of her campaign — there is scant criticism of campaign aides like <Entity>Robby Mook</Entity> or <Entity>John Podesta</Entity> — she acknowledged it never developed a message that resonated with voters like “Make America Great Again.” She also admitted to an unsettling sense, as she campaigned, that her campaign lacked the passion of <Entity>Bill Clinton’s</Entity> run for the White House in 1992.
“I was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions, while <Entity>Trump</Entity> was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans’ anger and resentment,” she wrote. “I was giving speeches laying out how to resolve the country’s problems. He was ranting on Twitter.”
