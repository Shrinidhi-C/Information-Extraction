As a Republican representative from Kansas elected in the Tea Party wave in 2011, Mr. <Entity>Pompeo,</Entity> 53, was among the most vocal opponents of Mr. <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> diplomacy with Tehran. Days after Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> was elected, he wrote on Twitter, “I look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.”
Later, at the C.I.A., Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> pushed for the release of classified documents from the raid that killed <Entity>Osama bin Laden,</Entity> which included evidence of links between <Entity>Al Qaeda</Entity> and Iran. Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> has said the move was in the interest of greater transparency. Critics say it was calculated to undermine support for the nuclear deal.
On North Korea, Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> has come as close as any <Entity>Trump</Entity> administration official to calling for the removal of that country’s leader, <Entity>Kim Jong-un.</Entity> Speaking in July at the Aspen Security Forum, he said that “the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over” North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.
“From the administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?” Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> said. “Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent and break those two apart.”
