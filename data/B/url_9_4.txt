Mr. <Entity>Jacobson</Entity> likened the AIDS campaign to fake Russian accounts and campaigns like Blacktivist and Black Fist that exploited the Black Lives Matter movement and heightened racial tensions in 2016.
The Twitter bots that helped spread viral fake news during the election last year have now morphed into cyborgs, or accounts that blend automation with human curation, said <Entity>Samantha Bradshaw,</Entity> a researcher on the Computational Propaganda Project at Oxford University. They are more difficult to identify, but still latch onto divisive issues and seek to deepen the wedge.
“The point is not to just tell a lie, but to tell a lie in increments,” Ms. <Entity>Bradshaw</Entity> said. “They get a little bit more absurd as you start release more and more stories.”
She pointed to the first case of social media disinformation, when Twitter and Facebook users lobbed theories about the disappearance in 2014 of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Rumors of its fate included a natural disaster, Ukrainians trying to assassinate President <Entity>Vladimir V. Putin</Entity> of Russia and a lost and confused World War II battalion emerging to shoot down the plane.
“This was not to convince people about the World War II battalion but telling them to distrust the media because they can’t get the story right in the first place,” Ms. <Entity>Bradshaw</Entity> said.
The White House, too, has recently attacked the news media for errors by major news outlets. But on Monday, Ms. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> said the <Entity>Trump</Entity> administration would not compare a foreign government’s disinformation campaign with a reporter’s mistakes.
