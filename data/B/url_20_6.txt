“That’s domestic politics,” said <Entity>Kunihiko Miyake,</Entity> a former Japanese diplomat now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “American political leaders, including Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> are hopefully wise enough to do their job on an external front even while they have to be more scared domestically.”
But others said the mushrooming investigation would deepen doubts about Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> reliability.
“It’s a question of optics,” said <Entity>Richard Javad Heydarian,</Entity> a political-science professor at De La Salle University in Manila. “The shadow of impeachment will cast doubt on whether <Entity>Trump</Entity> can deliver on any major initiative he promises.”
Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> performance over the next 11 days could alter that perception, for better or worse, which is why people inside and outside the White House are worried by a schedule that some liken to the deadly forced march of prisoners during World War II.
“This is actually two trips jammed together,” said <Entity>Daniel R. Russel,</Entity> who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs until March. “Either one would be pretty ambitious. Jammed together, they form a kind of Bataan Death March.”
