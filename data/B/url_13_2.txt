With another deadline looming next Monday, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is expected to sign an order keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv. But he will couple that with a statement that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital — something that no president, Republican or Democrat, has done since the state of Israel was established in 1948.
Given the extreme sensitivities surrounding Jerusalem, Middle East experts said Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> plan was fraught with risk. Even after extensive consultations with Arab leaders, which the White House has not done, such a move could provoke volatile reactions.
“The devil is in the details of what they announce,” said <Entity>Martin S. Indyk,</Entity> who served as American ambassador to Israel under President <Entity>Bill Clinton.</Entity> “If this is not framed properly, far from resolving this issue, it will land the administration in even hotter water.”
Among the questions, Mr. <Entity>Indyk</Entity> said, are whether Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will restrict recognition to West Jerusalem, whether he will mention Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem and how he will deal with Jerusalem’s status as a holy city — a factor that could determine whether Saudi Arabia supports or abandons his peace project.
