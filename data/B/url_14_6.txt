“The damage that has been done to the United States, and to the State Department, under <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> has really been profound,” said <Entity>Eliot A. Cohen,</Entity> a fierce critic of Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> who served as a top official in the department under President <Entity>George W. Bush.</Entity> “He is the worst secretary of state in our history.”
Mr. <Entity>Cohen</Entity> said that if Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> were named, he could use his politician’s skills to campaign more effectively for the State Department on budget issues. He should also have more success in filling the department’s depleted ranks. And his closeness to Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would give him credibility with foreign ministers that Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> seems to lack.
And yet it is precisely those qualities that could also enable Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> to tip the balance on fraught foreign policy issues.
“There will be many issues of foreign policy in which the balance between a hard line and a more moderate view are finely balanced,” said <Entity>Paul R. Pillar,</Entity> a longtime former C.I.A. official now at the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. “The voice of the secretary of state, leaning in one direction or another, will make a difference.”
