In 2013, Mr. <Entity>Higbie</Entity> was fresh out of the Navy, and transitioning back to civilian life, he said on Saturday.
“When I came out of the military, I struggled with how to accept Islam because of my experience overseas, as do a lot of veterans,” he said. “Those comments were directed at the faction that was either radicalized or tolerant of the radicalized ones.”
As for his views about homosexuality, Mr. <Entity>Higbie</Entity> said that he had recently developed some “very close friends” who are gay, and had learned that “it’s a live-and-let-live thing.”
“I met these people and I was like, ‘Wow, they’re normal people,’” he said. “It was a good experience for me to understand that you can’t just hate people because of that. Not that I hate them. I just didn’t understand the ideology. And I was wrong to have that opinion.”
Mr. <Entity>Higbie</Entity> also drew criticism in 2016, while serving as a spokesman for the pro-Trump group Great America PAC, when he said during an interview with <Entity>Megyn Kelly</Entity> on Fox News that there was “precedent” for creating a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries, a proposal met with strong opposition by civil rights activists.
