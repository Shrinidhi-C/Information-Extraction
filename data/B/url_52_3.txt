The CBS poll found that the Democratic convention improved Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> favorability rating and her standing with female voters, a group that was already strongly in her corner. She continues to trail Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> with men and white voters who do not have college degrees.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> post-convention bounce was in line with the upticks that President <Entity>Obama</Entity> received in 2008 and 2012. It was smaller than the 13-point increase that her husband, former President <Entity>Bill Clinton,</Entity> saw in 1992 or the 10-point bounce that <Entity>Al Gore</Entity> got in 2000.
