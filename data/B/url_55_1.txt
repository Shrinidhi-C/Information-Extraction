On the final night of the Democratic National Convention, a full slate of speakers, including state leaders, some Republicans and her daughter, <Entity>Chelsea Clinton,</Entity> preceded <Entity>Hillary Clinton’s</Entity> appearance.
The highlights (and our longer analysis):
• Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> wearing a white suit and a wide smile, accepted the Democratic nomination for president shortly before 11:00 Eastern time.
“It is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America’s promise,” she said over a roaring crowd, “that I accept your nomination for President of the United States.”
She welcomed the night’s historic nature, invoking her mother and her daughter, and tried to shed light on the motivation of her life’s work.
But mostly, she used a nearly hourlong speech to lay out a vision of America self-consciously in opposition to the one Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> put forth last week in Cleveland. To Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> promise that “I, alone, can fix it,” Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> countered that “none of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.”

• <Entity>Chelsea Clinton,</Entity> who grew up in the national spotlight, introduced her mother — “my wonderful, thoughtful, hilarious mother” — in starkly personal terms. Recounting notes left when her mother was out of town, conversations at the dinner table, and even Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> failed 1994 health care fight, Ms. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> said she is often asked how does her mother “keep going amid the sound and the fury of politics?”
“Here’s how,” she answered: “It’s because she never, ever forgets who she’s fighting for.”
