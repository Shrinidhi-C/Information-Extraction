• Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has trotted out a number of endorsements from professional athletes. On Monday, <Entity>Jason Collins,</Entity> the first N.B.A. player to come out as gay, and his brother and fellow N.B.A. player, <Entity>Jarron Collins,</Entity> gave Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> their support.
The Clintons, <Entity>Jason Collins</Entity> said, “knew that my sexual orientation made no difference in my ability to play basketball, just as someone’s gender makes no difference in his or her ability to lead our nation.”
<Entity>Jarron Collins</Entity> warned of the example Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would set for his own children, whose mother is Mexican-American. “When it comes to Donald Trump,” he said “how do you tell your kids not to be a bully if their president is one?”

• Senator <Entity>Kirsten Gillibrand</Entity> of New York, who was Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> successor in the Senate, zeroed in on the struggles of working parents.
