Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> claimed, without providing evidence, that “the regime intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.”
The White House did not respond when asked to identify an instance of intimidation. But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the watchdog group tasked with inspection, has yet to report issues with access.
“To my knowledge, there is no evidence of this. The I.A.E.A. has never said that this is the case,” said <Entity>Richard Nephew,</Entity> a former sanctions coordinator at the State Department and a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.
<Entity>Yukiya Amano,</Entity> the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, repeatedly stated in a September news briefing that Iran was following the rules. He did not mention any instances of intimidation.
