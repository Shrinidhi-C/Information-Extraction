Mr. <Entity>Kelly,</Entity> who arrived back in the United States with Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> Tuesday night aboard Air Force One, provided details about the president’s diplomatic outreach on behalf of the U.C.L.A. players.
“Our president said to <Entity>Xi,</Entity> ‘Do you know anything about these knuckleheads that got caught allegedly stealing?’” Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> said. Unaware of the episode, the Chinese president dispatched an aide to get more information. “The president was saying, ‘It’s not too serious. We’d love to see this taken care of in an expeditious way,’” Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> added.
The three players had been accused of shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store next to their hotel in Hangzhou, in eastern China, where they were preparing to play in a tournament. (Playing without the three freshmen, U.C.L.A. defeated Georgia Tech, 63-60, in Shanghai on Friday.)
Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> said Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> intervention, as well as diplomatic efforts by State Department diplomats, led to the reduction of the charges to the equivalent of misdemeanors as well as the release of the three players to their hotel, where they were placed under temporary house arrest. It was there that Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> talked to <Entity>Chris Carlson,</Entity> an associate athletic director at U.C.L.A., and to the players on the phone the next day.
“To say the least, they were very apologetic,” said Mr. <Entity>Kelly,</Entity> who pointedly did not ask the student-athletes whether they had, in fact, attempted to steal the merchandise they were accused of taking. “They were just profuse in their apologies for embarrassing the country and embarrassing the team.”
Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> told the players that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> had intervened on their behalf and that he was “very optimistic that this would be taken care of in short order.”
In China, where the justice system has a very high conviction rate, theft can bring punishment ranging from a few days to years in prison. Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> said that had the players been charged with the equivalent of felonies — because of the high cost of the merchandise — they could have received prison sentences of five to 10 years.
“I bet they learned a lesson in their lives,” he said.
