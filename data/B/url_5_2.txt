While hosting an internet radio broadcast, “Sound of Freedom,” in 2013, Mr. <Entity>Higbie</Entity> spoke of the “high percentage of people on welfare in the black race,” blaming “a lax of morality.” He added that taxpayers “are tired of supporting government checks going to these people who think that breeding is a form of employment,” CNN reported.
Mr. <Entity>Higbie,</Entity> 34, who is from Greenwich, Conn., said that at the time, he was trying to make a name for himself as a controversial radio host who taunted liberal guests and garnered ratings through “shock and awe.”
“I picked and prodded at every single guest I had in order to try to get a rise out of them,” he said on Saturday. “And it was just poor class.”
In one “Sound of Freedom” broadcast, Mr. <Entity>Higbie</Entity> said he opposed homosexuality in part because he was “molested by a gay guy” when he was a child, CNN reported.
“So I, I just, I really don’t care for them,” he said in 2013. “You know what, you want to be gay? Fine. Do it over in your own corner.”
Mr. <Entity>Higbie,</Entity> a former Navy SEAL who served two tours in Iraq, also said that those getting government assistance “at any given time during any election cycle” should “not get to vote at the subsequent election.” He said that 75 percent of people with post-traumatic stress disorder don’t have it, and “they’re either milking something for a little extra money in disability or they’re just, they honestly are just lying.”
Mr. <Entity>Higbie</Entity> also expressed disdain for Muslims several times.
“People say, ‘You know, you’re so harsh,’” he said on Warrior Talk Radio in August 2014. “I was called an Islamophobe and I was like: ‘No, no, no, no, no, I’m not afraid of them. I don’t like them. Big difference.’ And they were like, ‘Well, you’re racist.’ I was like, ‘Fine, if that’s the definition of it, then I guess I am.’”
