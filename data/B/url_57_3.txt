• Mr. <Entity>Bloomberg,</Entity> the former mayor of New York and a political independent who opted not to run for president, said he was addressing the convention to convey a single message: “It is an imperative that we elect <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> the next president of the United States.”
Leaning on his own business record, Mr. <Entity>Bloomberg,</Entity> a billionaire, said he understood “the appeal of a businessman president” but that Mr. Trump was “a risky, reckless, radical choice.”

<Entity>“Donald Trump</Entity> today once again took Russia’s side,” Mr. <Entity>Panetta</Entity> said, adding, “it is inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible.”

• Governor <Entity>Jerry Brown</Entity> of California turned the convention’s full attention toward climate change for the first time this week.
