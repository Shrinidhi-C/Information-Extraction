KANSAS CITY, Mo. — <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> quoted biblical scripture. She talked about her youth minister who took her from the safe harbor of suburbia to the inner city of Chicago, and she shared the memory of seeing her gruff father bent on his knees in prayer each night.
And, without ever mentioning <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> by name, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> portrayed her rival as a nihilist who doesn’t understand African-Americans or their faith.
The next president, she told the audience at the National Baptist Convention here on Thursday night, should be “a praying person.”
