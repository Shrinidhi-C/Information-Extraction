The facts are inescapable: The <Entity>Obama</Entity> years have been among the best of times to be a stock investor, going all the way back to the dawn of the 20th century.
Consider that had you been prescient enough to buy shares of a low-cost stock index fund on Mr. <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> first inauguration day, on Jan. 20, 2009, you would now have tripled your money. Stock market performance of this level has rarely been surpassed.
Yet this performance has not been as widely celebrated or appreciated as past bull markets have been, nor is it a major issue in this year’s presidential campaigns. The main reason may simply be that the current bull market is suspect because it came after one of the worst declines in stock market history.
“Politicians almost seem embarrassed to talk about the stock market,” said <Entity>Paul Hickey,</Entity> co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. “It’s not a popular thing right now. But when you look at it, the record of the market under <Entity>Obama</Entity> is kind of incredible.”
Buying stock wasn’t the obvious thing to do when Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> took office.
