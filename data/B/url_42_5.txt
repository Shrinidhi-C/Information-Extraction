Although <Entity>Gary Johnson,</Entity> the Libertarian Party nominee, has been dropping in most polls since he was left out of the presidential debates, the ticket could still have an impact in a close race, given its popularity in states such as New Mexico and Colorado.
Confusing the matter is the fact that <Entity>William F. Weld,</Entity> the party’s vice-presidential nominee, essentially endorsed Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in an interview with MSNBC’s <Entity>Rachel Maddow</Entity> on Tuesday night.
“Well I’m here vouching for Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and I think it’s high time somebody did and I’m doing it based on my personal experience with her and I think she deserves to have people vouch for her,” Mr. <Entity>Weld</Entity> said when asked if his loyalty to the Libertarian Party was stronger than his fear of a <Entity>Trump</Entity> presidency.
Mr. <Entity>Weld,</Entity> a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, acknowledged that he and Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> have many policy disagreements and that they no longer have a chance to win the presidency this year.
For his part, Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> has kept up his attacks on Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and in a debate with <Entity>Jill Stein,</Entity> the Green Party nominee, he suggested that she would be “engaged in the impeachment process” on day one if elected.
With his fired-up return to the trail on Tuesday, Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> showed again why he is Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> most valuable surrogate. He is the most popular person in national politics and perhaps uniquely effective at reaching black voters and young people at a moment when Democrats are anxious about turnout. That makes him a powerful asset to Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> in a state like North Carolina, where he campaigned on Wednesday.
“I hate to put pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders,” Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> said at rally in North Carolina.
