Chad was added to Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> updated travel ban in late September. In October — around the same time as the ambush — Chad withdrew troops from the Diffa region of Niger. But these troops were fighting Boko Haram in the east, while the American soldiers were fighting a different Islamic militant group in Tongo Tongo, a village hundreds of miles to the west.
“These are two completely different conflicts,” said <Entity>Laura Seay,</Entity> a professor of African politics at Colby College. Geography aside, she said, there is little evidence that the militants operating in the west were emboldened by Chad’s withdrawal in the east as “they were carrying out attacks pretty regularly” before the Oct. 4 ambush.
Viral social media posts have called the Niger attack “Benghazi on steroids,” pointing to alleged misconduct by the <Entity>Trump</Entity> administration.
For example, one post that claims the journalist <Entity>Dan Rather</Entity> said that “the <Entity>Trump</Entity> Pentagon gave these men bad intel, no support, outsourced rescue people.” But there is no evidence that Mr. <Entity>Rather</Entity> made these remarks, and many details about the Niger ambush have yet to emerge. The Pentagon and F.B.I. are investigating the operation, including discrepancies between American and Nigerien troops’ accounts about what prompted the attack.
