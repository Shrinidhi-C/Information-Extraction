The Saudi crown prince, <Entity>Mohammed bin Salman,</Entity> is close to Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, <Entity>Jared Kushner,</Entity> who is running the administration’s peace initiative. Diplomats in the region have been buzzing that the crown prince recently presented the Palestinian Authority president, <Entity>Mahmoud Abbas,</Entity> with the outlines of an American plan — something the Saudis and the White House deny.
Mr. <Entity>Macron</Entity> has also developed a good relationship with Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> particularly since he invited the president to Paris last July for Bastille Day celebrations. But the two leaders are far apart on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal.
Some experts say Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will find it impossible to square his campaign promise with his goal of brokering the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians.
“You can’t either move the embassy or even declare Jerusalem the capital without driving the Palestinians away from the negotiating table, and winning them the support of the Arabs in doing so,” said <Entity>Daniel C. Kurtzer,</Entity> a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt.
