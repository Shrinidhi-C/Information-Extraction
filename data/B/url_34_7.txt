Other readers would like to see Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> be transparent with the American people.
“Americans need <Entity>Trump</Entity> to come clean on his ties to Russia. Our national security is compromised.” — <Entity>John Adams</Entity> in California
“I am no expert in how campaigns are run but it seems believable that it’s normal (and perhaps advisable) for them to talk to important foreign players.
