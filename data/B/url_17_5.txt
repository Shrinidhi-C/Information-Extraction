The warm presidential relationship appeared to pay off with the release of <Entity>Ball,</Entity> a freshman guard; and <Entity>Cody Riley</Entity> and <Entity>Jalen Hill,</Entity> both freshman forwards. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> emphasized that it was a “very, very rough situation, with what happened to them.”
The highest-profile of the three who had been detained was <Entity>Ball,</Entity> the middle of three sons in a basketball-playing family so well known that it has its own reality show on Facebook, “Ball in the Family.” The eldest brother, <Entity>Lonzo,</Entity> plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, and the youngest, <Entity>LaMelo,</Entity> is a high schooler who has committed to play at U.C.L.A. Their father, <Entity>LaVar,</Entity> has become a public figure, and has started a sports-apparel company, Big Baller Brand, to market both his sons and the family name.
The U.C.L.A. team’s trip to China had been seen as a way to raise the profile of the university in that country, possibly attracting students who have well-to-do parents and who want to study abroad. Many American universities in recent years have increasingly relied on tuition payments from foreign students.
The arrests of the three young men could have derailed efforts to bridge the cultural divide. Hours before their release, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> told reporters that the incident “was not something that should have happened.”
But even then the president seemed to know something positive might be in the works. Asked if he expected to see the basketball players coming home soon, he answered: “I hope so. I hope so.”
Just hours later, they were on a plane, too.
