Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> has been less blithe in his handling of the issue. When he met the Russian foreign minister, <Entity>Sergey V. Lavrov,</Entity> in the Philippines in August, he said he told him “just how serious this incident had been and how seriously it had damaged the relationship between the U.S. and the American people and the Russian people.”
Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> weighed in with Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> after the president openly backed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a bitter dispute with neighboring Qatar. Pointing out that Qatar played host to a major American air base, Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> helped persuade Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> to shift to a more neutral role, urging both sides to settle their differences.
To some in Washington, Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> has served as a type of adult supervision for Mr. <Entity>Trump.</Entity> He, along with Mr. <Entity>Mattis</Entity> and the White House chief of staff, <Entity>John F. Kelly,</Entity> “are those people that help separate our country from chaos,” said Senator <Entity>Bob Corker,</Entity> Republican of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Critics, though, point out that Mr. <Entity>Tillerson’s</Entity> involvement did not lead to a resolution of the Saudi-Qatar dispute. Nor have his diplomatic labors eased tensions with North Korea. Mr. <Entity>Tillerson’s</Entity> isolated management style and antagonistic relations with his own agency more than outweighed any beneficial effects from his moderate inclinations.
