WASHINGTON — Call it the two birds, one tweet approach: As he continues to feud with Senator <Entity>Bob Corker,</Entity> President <Entity>Trump</Entity> is now also blaming the Tennessee Republican for the Iran nuclear deal that the White House is threatening to decertify, perhaps as soon as this week.
But it is a misleading charge: Mr. <Entity>Corker,</Entity> who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, repeatedly spoke out against the accord to limit Tehran’s nuclear program before it was brokered by world powers in 2015.
