Mr. <Entity>Jones</Entity> has received support in the form of independent expenditures (for example, television ads) worth millions from outside groups. Again, Planned Parenthood is not among them, but they do include the political action committees of a steel union, a civil-rights group and a new group called Highway 31, which has not publicly disclosed its donors.
Mr. <Entity>Jones</Entity> does support abortion rights but <Entity>Janet Porter,</Entity> a spokeswoman for Mr. <Entity>Moore’s</Entity> campaign, misrepresented his position in a CNN interview this week.
In its landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court legalized abortion up until the fetus is viable or can survive outside the womb, or after that point to protect the health and life of the mother. About a third of states let doctors determine viability, and half limit abortion to a specific time frame. In Alabama, that point is 22 weeks of gestation.
Only 1.3 percent of abortions in the United States occur past the first 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights. The situation that Ms. <Entity>Porter</Entity> described — an abortion performed just before or on the due date — does not exist.
“When a woman is near her due date and has a medical condition that requires ending the pregnancy, the treatment is delivery of the baby,” said Dr. <Entity>Daniel Grossman,</Entity> a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.
