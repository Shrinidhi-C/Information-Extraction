Some of President <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> liberal critics are characterizing the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger that killed four American soldiers as “Benghazi on steroids” — a reference to the yearslong partisan uproar over the 2012 attacks on two United States compounds in Libya.
A few parallels can be drawn between the incidents. In each, four Americans died at the hands of Islamic extremists. After the Benghazi attacks, the <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration struggled to explain exactly what happened, and why. And now, President <Entity>Trump</Entity> and his top officials have yet to satisfy questions from Congress about the deaths in Niger, Republicans and Democrats said on Thursday.
But popular allegations about Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> role in Niger have ranged from premature to conspiratorial.
Liberal blog posts, shared online tens of thousands of times, falsely claim that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> sent American troops to Niger to aid Russia. One, for example, reads: “Four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger two weeks ago, and no one knows what they were doing there — except that it came shortly after Niger curiously signed a military cooperation agreement with Russia.”
