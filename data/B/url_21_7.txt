<Entity>Trump</Entity> officials, on the other hand, have been largely silent in the three weeks since the Niger ambush. Beyond defending his remarks to Sergeant <Entity>Johnson’s</Entity> widow, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said on Wednesday afternoon that he did not specifically order the Niger mission, though he gave generals “the authority to do what’s right so that we win.” <Entity>Sarah Huckabee Sanders,</Entity> the White House press secretary, has repeatedly declined to give details about the raid during news conferences.
As for inquiries, the F.B.I. began an investigation two days after the Benghazi attacks, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing about a month after. Congress conducted eight investigations of the circumstances surrounding the violence in Benghazi, the last of which concluded last year. In the end, lawmakers broadly chided the State Department for being inadequately prepared but did not find any clear misconduct that caused the deaths.
The Pentagon said the Niger incident was under investigation six days after the deadly attack. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate were briefed by two senior Pentagon officials about the details of the attack in a classified session on Thursday, and appeared divided along party lines as to whether the deaths could have been avoided.
But senators from both parties agreed that their questions have not been answered. “They owe us more information, and I think we’ll get it,” Senator <Entity>Roger Wicker,</Entity> Republican of Mississippi, told CNN.
