Officials credit Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> with imposing discipline on an unruly West Wing staff and on how information is given to the president.
As a wartime commander, Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> led troops in intense combat in western Iraq. In 2003, he became the first Marine colonel since 1951 to be promoted to brigadier general while in active combat.
The death of Mr. <Entity>Kellyâ€™s</Entity> son may have played a role in his selection to the cabinet. During the transition, people close to Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said he wanted people on his national security team who understood personally the hazards of sending Americans into battle.
But Mr. <Entity>Kelly</Entity> has been reluctant to discuss his son. He asked the hosts of the eulogy he gave, in St. Louis in 2010, not to mention Lieutenant Kelly when they introduced him.
