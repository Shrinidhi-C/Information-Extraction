And so the two will make their first joint campaign appearance next week, in Wisconsin, one of a series of events they are expected to hold together.
Over the course of a toxic presidential race, both Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> have accrued historically high negative ratings in polls. Mr. <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> numbers, perhaps as a result of the vitriolic presidential race, have improved. And he hopes that his endorsement of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> announced after he held a meeting on Thursday with her rival, <Entity>Bernie Sanders,</Entity> will bring the Vermont senator’s supporters to her side.
Still, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> needs to maintain a separate political identity from Mr. <Entity>Obama’s.</Entity> And so, while the accelerated endorsement from Mr. <Entity>Obama</Entity> was welcomed by Democrats who have been urging the party to unite, the general-election campaign needs to remain Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> show.
