All eyes were on Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence</Entity> of Indiana as he accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, its third night, and made the case for <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> as a Christian and a conservative. 
Keeping in the line of “Making America” something, the night’s theme was “Making America First Again,” and featured speeches by <Entity>Newt Gingrich,</Entity> the former House speaker; <Entity>Eric Trump,</Entity> one of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> sons; and Senator <Entity>Ted Cruz</Entity> of Texas, one of his former rivals.
The highlights:
• If you were waiting for the usual kind of convention speech, you just saw it. Mr. <Entity>Pence,</Entity> the nominee for vice president, delivered what may have been the only speech that closely resembled the typical presentation at a nominating convention. He thanked his family, introduced his wife, lauded his ticket-mate, ticked off policy ideas, made a few jokes and expressed optimism about the country and his party’s chances to win in November.
“It’s change versus the status quo, and when Donald Trump is president, the change will be huge,” Mr. <Entity>Pence</Entity> said. He criticized <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> and the Democratic Party, describing them as “entrenched in power.” He closed out Day 3 of the convention by declaring, “We have but one choice” — to elect <Entity>Donald Trump</Entity> the 45th president.

• After an extended and often soaring speech focusing on notes of freedom and American conservative ideals, Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> refused to specifically call for Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> election, despite repeated shouts from the crowd to endorse him, including “We want Trump!” He chided the crowd and said, “Don’t stay home in November,” but he also told them to “vote their conscience.”
As Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> wrapped up his extended remarks, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> emerged from a side entrance, waving to the crowd. He joined his family in the V.I.P. box, as both the crowd and every television camera cut from Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> just as he was delivering the crescendo to his remarks. He closed saying, “God bless America” on a split screen, as the cameras had shifted to Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> who in a rare spontaneous moment at the often orchestrated conventions, stole the show from Mr. <Entity>Cruz</Entity> once more.
