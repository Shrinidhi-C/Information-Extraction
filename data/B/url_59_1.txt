PHILADELPHIA — The prime-time lineup for Night 1 of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia was full of political star power: the first lady, <Entity>Michelle Obama;</Entity> Senator <Entity>Elizabeth Warren</Entity> of Massachusetts, and Senator <Entity>Bernie Sanders</Entity> of Vermont all addressed the crowd, and speeches were given by athletes, activists and celebrities.
Here are the highlights::
• In an emotional finale to his campaign, Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> was greeted with a standing ovation and was frequently interrupted by thunderous applause. Speaking directly to his supporters — many of whom were in the hall as delegates — he sympathized with their disappointment and urged them to take “enormous pride” in what they had started. But, he said, the time had come.
“By these measures, any objective observer will conclude that — based on her ideas and her leadership — <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> must become the next president of the United States,” Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> said several minutes into his remarks. “The choice is not even close.”
