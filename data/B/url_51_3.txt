Using the <Entity>Dow Jones</Entity> industrial average, market performance has been better only during the presidencies of <Entity>Calvin Coolidge,</Entity> a Republican, in the Roaring ’20s; and <Entity>Bill Clinton,</Entity> a Democrat, from 1993 to early 2001, years that encompassed the tech bubble.
The market under President <Entity>Obama</Entity> has risen 11.8 percent, on an annualized basis, without dividends. That compares with 25.5 percent for President <Entity>Coolidge</Entity> and 15.9 percent for President <Entity>Clinton.</Entity> It exceeds the Dow’s performance for everyone else, including three Republicans who were known for being pro-business and for tenures that coincided with strong stock markets: <Entity>Ronald Reagan,</Entity> with 11.3 percent; <Entity>Dwight D. Eisenhower,</Entity> with 10.4 percent; and <Entity>George H. W. Bush,</Entity> with 9.7 percent.
It’s also noteworthy that since 1900, the market has performed better under Democrats, with a 6.7 percent annualized gain for the Dow, compared with a 3 percent gain under Republicans. Is it reasonable to conclude that Democratic presidents are better for stock investing than Republicans are? Probably not, especially with party alignments and policy positions in an extreme state of flux this year; even if this were true in the past, it may not be so in 2016 or in the future.
Furthermore, if the direct impact of presidential policy on the economy is debatable, the effects on the stock market are even less clear. It is certainly difficult to demonstrate a strong cause and effect. But Mr. Hickey gave it a try: “Democrats spread the money around more than Republicans do, stimulating consumer spending, which is good for the economy and for the stock market,” he said, but that this connection is hard to quantify conclusively.
That said, there are two obvious reasons for the market’s stellar performance in the <Entity>Obama</Entity> years.
