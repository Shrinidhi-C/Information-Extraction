The United States was still in the grips of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the <Entity>Dow Jones</Entity> industrial average had already declined 34 percent over the previous 12 months — and it was still dropping.
People were fleeing the stock market. Many of them never returned and so never benefited from the last seven and a half years of rising asset prices. Federal Reserve data and Gallup poll data both indicate that direct and indirect stock ownership by American households is lower than it was at the beginning of President <Entity>Obama’s</Entity> first term in office.
Wealthy people own stock, of course, but many people of more modest incomes do not. Unlike the days of the internet bubble in the late 1990s or the boom of the 1920s, when everybody seemed to be exchanging stock tips, the market these days is not terribly fashionable.
Yet the market performance record is first-rate. I asked Mr. <Entity>Hickey</Entity> to run the historical numbers, and he found that since 1900, the <Entity>Obama</Entity> presidency has so far been the third best for stock investors.
