Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> did not address the fact that the Air Force has said it should have entered the assailant, <Entity>Devin P. Kelley,</Entity> into a federal database after he was court-martialed on domestic violence charges years ago. That would have prohibited him from legally buying the military-style rifle he used to kill 26 parishioners on Sunday inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex.
Mr. <Entity>Kelley</Entity> was shot twice by the armed bystander after he walked out of the church, having finished his killing spree inside. He might have continued his attack elsewhere, but the entire town of Sutherland Springs only has about 600 people.
Instead, a wounded Mr. <Entity>Kelley</Entity> led the bystander and another man on a dramatic car chase that ended in a crash. He was found dead in his car of what the police said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
