<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> raised $100 million in small donations in October, his campaign announced on Thursday. But Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> announcement — made in a news release sent to reporters late in the afternoon — contained few other details, and his figures cannot be independently verified until after Election Day, when the winning and losing campaigns file their next financial disclosures with the Federal Election Commission.
Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> tally appeared to include money raised into party accounts he jointly controls, but did not specify what threshold he used for “small” donations, and a spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for clarification. The release did not specify whether the total represented any money that was raised earlier in the year but was only recently transferred into his campaign accounts.
The <Entity>Trump</Entity> team’s last official F.E.C. report was filed last week and covered the first 19 days of October. Using a conventional measure of small donations — checks from people giving less than $200 — Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> would have had to raise about $65 million from small contributions during the remaining days in October, effectively tripling his clip with these donors. That would be a huge jump.
But it is also possible that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is including contributions of more than $200 in his tally, since he has been collecting relatively few large checks. If Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> figure included all the money raised in the first part of October, then he would have had to raise $40 million to reach $100 million by the end of the month.
That would leave him at more or less on the same pace as earlier in the month — and only a slightly faster clip than in September.
