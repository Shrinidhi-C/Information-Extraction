Mr. <Entity>Francis</Entity> said he believed that “a lot of this increase is the police recording more minor violent crimes — assault without injury — which might in the past have been ignored in their figures.”
The statistical agency attributes the 13 percent increase to “a range of factors, including continuing improvements to crime recording and genuine increases in some crime categories, especially in those that are well recorded.”
Even Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> suggestion that there has been an overall increase in British crime is disputed.
The 13 percent increase reflects the rise in crimes recorded by the police, but a national statistical authority determined in 2014 that police figures were unreliable. As a result, the metric of “police-recorded crimes” is no longer an official statistic.
Another yardstick, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, is still considered an official statistic. It shows no change in crimes. As in the United States, crime in England and Wales has steadily declined since the 1990s.
The bulletin cited by Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> also cautions against relying on a year-to-year change in police reports alone to extrapolate a trend.
“Police figures cannot provide a good measure of all crime in society, since we know that a large volume of it never comes to their attention,” <Entity>John Flatley,</Entity> the head of the statistical agency, said in the release. “The recent increases in recorded crime need to be seen in the context of the overall decline in crime indicated by the Crime Survey for England and Wales.”
