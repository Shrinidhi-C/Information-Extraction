Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> has explicitly ruled out regime change as the administration’s policy. In White House debates, he has argued for keeping the door open to diplomacy, despite Mr. <Entity>Kim’s</Entity> repeated missile launches and Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> threats to use military force against the North.
The secretary of state’s public statements have been more measured than those of the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <Entity>H.R. McMaster,</Entity> who has spoken of the possibility of waging a “preventive war” against North Korea — let alone the president, who on Wednesday labeled Mr. <Entity>Kim</Entity> “Little Rocket Man” and a “sick puppy.”
Mr. <Entity>Pompeo,</Entity> by contrast, has been uncommonly vocal for a C.I.A. director, whose job traditionally is to present the president with unvarnished intelligence rather than to influence policy debates. In Aspen, he likened Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal to a bad tenant paying rent.
“They don’t pay the rent, you call them, and then they send a check and it doesn’t clear,” Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> said. “And then the next day, there’s this tired old sofa in the front yard.”
When pressed on Russia’s meddling in the election, which the C.I.A. has confirmed, he expressed an impatience that sounded a lot like Mr. <Entity>Trump’s.</Entity>
“It’s true, yeah, of course,” Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> said. He added it was true of the election “before that, and the one before that. They’ve been at this a hell of a long time. And I don’t think they have any intention of backing off.”
