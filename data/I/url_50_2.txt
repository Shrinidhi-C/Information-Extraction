Titled “Two Americas: Economy,” the new ad features struggling workers in crumbling neighborhoods and declares that under Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> leadership the country would experience “more of the same, but worse.” The ad then cuts to Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> economic vision, with happy workers enjoying higher wages and more jobs. It concludes with a shot of the glistening new 1 World Trade Center.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has so far been lagging far behind Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> when it comes to spending on advertising. This month, his campaign invested $4 million for ads in four swing states to hammer home his immigration message. The <Entity>Clinton</Entity> campaign has spent more than $60 million so far.
During the primary election season, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> was also slow to spend on television ads, instead relying on free exposure gained through regular news conferences and interviews with an array of media outlets.
But since becoming the Republican nominee, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has scaled down that approach, favoring conservative outlets and scripted speeches.
