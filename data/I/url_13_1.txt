WASHINGTON — President <Entity>Trump</Entity> plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital but not to move the American Embassy there for now, people briefed on the deliberations said on Friday, a halfway gesture intended to fulfill a campaign pledge while not derailing his peace initiative.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is expected to announce the decision in a speech next Wednesday, these people said, though they cautioned that the president had not yet formally signed off on it and that the details of the plan could shift.
Those details, experts warned, are fiendishly complicated. The diplomatic status of Jerusalem is one of the world’s most contested issues, with Israel and the Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Its holy sites are sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and any change in its status would have vast repercussions across the Middle East and other Islamic-majority countries worldwide.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv as one of his first acts as president — a pledge that was popular with his evangelical supporters as well as with powerful Jewish donors, like the casino mogul <Entity>Sheldon Adelson.</Entity>
American presidents must sign a national security waiver every six months to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv. In June, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> deferred a decision to move it to Jerusalem, under pressure from Arab leaders, who warned that it would ignite protests, and from advisers, including his son-in-law, <Entity>Jared Kushner,</Entity> who worried that it could strangle the administration’s attempt to foster peace in the generations-long dispute.
