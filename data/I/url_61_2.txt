The poll is in line with other surveys of Ohio voters that show the race being very close. Ohio is a critical battleground that could dictate the outcome of the election, and both candidates are expected to campaign aggressively across the state.
Mr. <Entity>Paleologos</Entity> noted that there is a sharp contrast between how the candidates perform in urban centers such as Cleveland, which favors Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> and the outer counties that lean toward Mr. <Entity>Trump.</Entity> Although the addition of Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence</Entity> as Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> running mate has not had an immediate impact, Mr. <Entity>Paleologos</Entity> suggests that it could help him in areas that border Mr. <Entity>Pence’s</Entity> home state of Indiana.
Terrorism and the economy, which are seen as strong areas for Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> remain the most important issues to voters in Ohio. Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration has not turned off voters, as 48 percent support the idea and 45 percent oppose it.
Third-party candidates could end up being the deciding factor in the race in Ohio, as the 5 percent of the vote that Mr. <Entity>Johnson</Entity> is getting is siphoning more support away from Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> than it is from Mrs. <Entity>Clinton.</Entity>
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
