WASHINGTON — For all his political and bureaucratic stumbles, Secretary of State <Entity>Rex W. Tillerson</Entity> has been a steady voice of moderation in how the Trump administration engages with the world.
That voice will be lost if, as expected, President <Entity>Trump</Entity> replaces Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> at the State Department with <Entity>Mike Pompeo,</Entity> a hard-line former Republican congressman who has brought an avowedly political edge to the Central Intelligence Agency, where he is the director.
Mr. <Entity>Pompeo,</Entity> a West Point graduate best known for savaging <Entity>Hillary Clinton’s</Entity> response to the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, when she was secretary of state, has called for the Iran nuclear agreement to be ripped up, played down talk of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and suggested that regime change in North Korea would be a welcome development.
Those views have put him in good stead with Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> whom White House aides said has come to value Mr. <Entity>Pompeo’s</Entity> pungent opinions and hard-charging style during his presidential daily briefings. Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> by contrast, has publicly undermined Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> while the secretary of state has responded with thinly veiled contempt.
