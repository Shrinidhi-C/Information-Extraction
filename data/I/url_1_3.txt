During the 2016 campaign, Mr. <Entity>Romney</Entity> decried Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> as a “fraud” and a “phony,” and said that he was “playing the American public for suckers.” But after the election, he embarked on a more cordial relationship with the president, as his name was one of several in the discussion of possible nominees for Secretary of State. After the violent events in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, he again changed his approach, imploring the president to apologize for saying that there had been blame on both sides.
“What he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn,” he said in a Facebook post in August.
The two have talked more recently, but Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has not offered his support for Mr. <Entity>Romney’s</Entity> campaign. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement.
Mr. <Entity>Romney</Entity> is well-known to many Americans, having run for president twice, once in 2008 and again in 2012, when he faced <Entity>Barack Obama</Entity> as the Republican Party’s nominee. After losing, he remained relatively visible, first with the debut of the 2014 documentary <Entity>“Mitt,”</Entity> an intimate look at his campaigns that made Mr. <Entity>Romney</Entity> seem less awkward and ill-at-ease than he often had while campaigning, and then with his comments about Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> in 2016.
