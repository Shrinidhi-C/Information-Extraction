Broad support from women and minority voters has helped <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> open an early lead over <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> nationally, according to a new poll released on Monday.
A Monmouth University survey found that 47 percent of registered voters back Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, while 40 percent support Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the Republican Party’s standard-bearer. The survey is the latest in a succession of recent polls that show Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> having an advantage, as Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> campaign has sputtered amid internal strife and an array of provocative public comments.
<Entity>“Clinton</Entity> has the advantage as the general election campaign kicks off, particularly in key swing states,” said <Entity>Patrick Murray,</Entity> director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement. “However, all signs point to 2016 turning out the most polarized electorate in memory.”
The lack of diversity that comprises Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> core supporters has become a problem for his general election prospects. The poll found Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> drawing the support of 72 percent of minority voters and 57 percent of female voters. Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> holds more modest leads among men and white voters.
