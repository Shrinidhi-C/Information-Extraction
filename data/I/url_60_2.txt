“America is better than <Entity>Donald Trump,”</Entity> Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> campaign chairman, <Entity>John Podesta,</Entity> said in a statement. He said that in Philadelphia, Democrats planned to “focus on issues, not anger” and “offer a positive vision for the future based on lifting America up, not tearing Americans down.”
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> had another interpretation of a Republican convention that largely focused on attacking her. “It was kind of perversely flattering,” she told a crowd of more than 3,000 at a rally in Tampa on Friday evening.
In a jab at Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> she showed solidarity with his main rival for the nomination. “I mean, I never thought I’d say these words, but <Entity>Ted Cruz</Entity> was right,” she said, and then quoted from Mr. <Entity>Cruz’s</Entity> speech on Wednesday night: “Vote your conscience.”
Her words might serve as some comfort for anxious Democrats who watched Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> speech unfurl amid Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> declining poll numbers, which have shown a majority of voters say they do not trust or like the former secretary of state.
The full force of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> supporters outside the campaign sprung to present her as the human shield to a <Entity>Trump</Entity> presidency.
