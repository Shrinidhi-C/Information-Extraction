The tape, without question, is real.
The famed recording of <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> making vulgar comments about women while filming a segment for “Access Hollywood,” which was first reported by The Washington Post roughly a month before last year’s presidential election, figured prominently in the final stretch of the race. Its authenticity wasn’t challenged at the time.
But Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> suggested to a senator earlier this year that the tape was not authentic, The Times reported on Saturday, and he recently repeated that contention to an adviser.
The claim does not hold up to scrutiny.
“Let us make this perfectly clear: The tape is very real,” <Entity>Natalie Morales,</Entity> an “Access Hollywood” host, said during Monday’s broadcast. “Remember his excuse at the time was ‘locker room talk.’ He said every one of those words.”
Hours after the tape was published last October, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> directly acknowledged that it was genuine.
“I said it, I was wrong and I apologize,” he said in a video recording.
Here is the relevant portion of the transcript.
