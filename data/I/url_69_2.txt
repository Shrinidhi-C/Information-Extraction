Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> also said he expected to announce his choice of a running mate by Friday, winding down a process that has been closely watched as in all likelihood the most significant decision he will make in his campaign.
“I have five candidates, plus two, two that are unknown to anybody,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said from Chicago, where he was raising money for his campaign.
“I will be making a decision over the next three- to four-day period of time, and I think it will be a decision that will be a very good decision for a lot of people,” he added.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said that he was not basing his vice-presidential selection on fund-raising prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative.
“I’ve been with these people for a long time — I know them,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said, specifically invoking Gov. <Entity>Chris Christie</Entity> of New Jersey and <Entity>Newt Gingrich,</Entity> the former House speaker. “Christie was excellent yesterday and Newt is excellent.” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will appear on Tuesday night in Indiana with Gov. <Entity>Mike Pence,</Entity> who has risen in the estimation of many of the nominee’s advisers.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said his decision was largely coming down to instinct. “A lot of is gut. A lot of it is,” he said. “My whole life has been about gut.”
