Some  called the difference in the treatment of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> an example of male privilege.
“Lets see. <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> uses an unprotected server, putting her messages at risk of being intercepted by the Russians. Meanwhile <Entity>Donald Trump</Entity> and his gang communicated directly with the Russians before the election. That’s OK because they’re successful hard driving business executives who play all the angles? That’s male privilege at its absolute best.” — <Entity>Carl Hultberg</Entity> in New Hampshire
