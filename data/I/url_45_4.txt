The speech on Thursday was the first of several in which Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> will try to connect her personal motivations with policies. In the coming weeks, she will give at least three addresses, about the economy, proposals to help children and families and a call to national service.
She sought to reinforce her deep roots in African-American churches on Thursday, paying tribute to several of the Baptist congregations she had visited during the campaign, and present herself as the antithesis of Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> who drew criticism last week after revelations that his campaign had prewritten questions and responses when he spoke at a black church.
“I’m sure you’re sick and tired of politicians who think they can just show up at election time, say a few nice words and earn your support,” said Mrs. Clinton, whose relationship with the group stretches back decades.
