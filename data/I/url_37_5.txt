“To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him,” Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> said.
Mr. <Entity>Ryan</Entity> congratulated Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> for accomplishing an “enormous political feat” on Wednesday and said that he was looking forward to working with him to carry forward a Republican policy agenda and prioritize the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
“This health care law is not a popular law,” Mr. <Entity>Ryan</Entity> said, adding that Congress had already shown it can get a repeal bill to the president’s desk. “This health care law is collapsing of its own weight.”
