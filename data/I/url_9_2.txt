“Whether it is ‘Brexit’ or the American election, Russian propaganda still infects U.S. social media networks,” Dr. <Entity>Jacobson</Entity> said. “And we see the same sort of divisive propaganda that we saw during the Cold War.”
Called Operation Infektion by the East German foreign intelligence service, the 1980s disinformation campaign seeded a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes AIDS was the product of biological weapons experiments conducted by the United States. The disease disproportionately impacts gay men, and the Reagan administration’s slow response had escalated into suspicions in the gay community that the United States government was responsible for its origins.
“The K.G.B. picked up on that, and added a new twist with a specific location: Fort Detrick, Md.,” where military scientists conducted biological weapons experiments in the 1950s and 1960s, said <Entity>Douglas Selvage,</Entity> the project director at the Office of the Federal Commissioner for Stasi Records in Berlin.
The K.G.B. campaign began with an anonymous letter in Patriot, a small newspaper published in New Delhi that was later revealed to have received Soviet funding. It ran in July 1983, under the headline “AIDS May Invade India: Mystery Disease Caused by U.S. Experiments” and pinned the origin of the disease to Fort Detrick.
The choice of Patriot was deliberate, said <Entity>Thomas Boghardt,</Entity> a military and intelligence historian who traced how the campaign unfolded. “It had no explicit links to the Soviets and was an English-language newspaper easily accessible to a global audience.
“The Soviets intuitively understood how the human psyche works,” Dr. <Entity>Boghardt</Entity> said. He said the playbook was simple but effective: Identify internal strife, point to inconsistencies and ambiguities in the news, fill them with meaning and “repeat, repeat, repeat.”
