<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> on Sunday renewed his call for the United States to consider profiling as a preventive tactic against terrorism in the aftermath of the mass shooting last week in Orlando, Fla.
“I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,” Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> issued a similar call in December after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., which left 14 people dead and more than 20 injured.
On Sunday, he also sought to downplay any differences between his positions on gun control and those of the National Rifle Association. Last week, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> wrote on Twitter that people on the government’s terrorist watch list should be barred from buying firearms, a stance that contradicts that of the N.R.A.
But Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> seems to be backtracking, saying on ABC’s “This Week” that he “understands exactly” the N.R.A.’s objections to restricting access to people on the watch list.
“A lot of people are on the list that really maybe shouldn’t be on the list, and their rights are being taken away,” he said.
