During this time period, liberal think tanks and analysts made the same point as Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> about Amazon’s effect on localities.
“Amazon’s refusal to collect sales tax in most states hurts state and local governments’ ability to finance education, health care and other services,” the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in 2010.
The company began to collect sales taxes in 2012 in California, where it began to build warehouses, as well as in Texas, Pennsylvania and other states, The Times reported. By the end of 2016, Amazon’s tax collection had expanded to 29 states, according to Mr. <Entity>Davis.</Entity>
And as of this April, Amazon has collected sales taxes in all states that have one. (Five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon — do not.) Amazon does not, however, require third-party sellers on its marketplace to collect sales taxes, but offers the service to them.
“Other large e-retailers, most notably eBay, generally do not collect sales tax still,” said <Entity>Joseph Henchman,</Entity> the executive vice president of the free-market-oriented Tax Foundation. Amazon, on the other hand, “ultimately changed their position.”
