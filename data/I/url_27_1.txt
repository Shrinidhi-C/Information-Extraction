During his recent social media fusillade against the N.F.L. and its players, President <Entity>Trump</Entity> claimed that ratings for football games were “way down,” except during pregame shows “when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!”
But data released Tuesday contradicts Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> point. Ratings for the N.F.L.’s Week 3 games — the first played since he suggested players who don’t stand for the national anthem should be fired — actually increased by 3 percent from last year, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Viewership did decline during three Sunday games, but increased in the 1 p.m. slot on CBS as well as during Thursday Night Football. Monday night’s game, between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals, spiked 63 percent in viewership from last year when the game shared the same time slot as the first presidential debate.
A White House spokesman referred The Times to viewership increases in pregame shows, so Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has a point that his comments may have had an impact.
