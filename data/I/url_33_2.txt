Readers believed Mr. <Entity>Comey</Entity> was doomed once he admitted that there was an investigation into the <Entity>Trump</Entity> administration’s dealings with Russia. Days before he was fired, Mr. <Entity>Comey</Entity> had asked for funds to continue that inquiry.
“It wasn’t hard to see this coming; the investigation into possible <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign dealings with Russia’s intelligence network has been a sharp sword hanging over the President’s head.
Being an opportunist, <Entity>[Trump]</Entity> just saw an opportunity to replace <Entity>Comey</Entity> with a more compliant F.B.I. director who will make the investigation go away.”

“While I disagree with <Entity>Comey</Entity> and the <Entity>Clinton</Entity> emails, he was trying to walk between the Scylla and Charybdis of partisan politics and an open investigation of Russian tampering in the American election to help <Entity>Trump</Entity> win.”

Readers suggested that <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> own conduct necessitated the firing. 
“If you read the FACTS set forth in the Deputy Attorney General’s conclusions regarding <Entity>Comey’s</Entity> conduct, his temperament and his profound lack of judgment, you have to agree that POTUS had to fire him. Should have happened sooner. <Entity>Comey</Entity> was a mess. He was totally in the wrong job.”
— <Entity>R. Mackinnon</Entity> in Concord, Mass.
