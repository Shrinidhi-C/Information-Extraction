PHILADELPHIA — After a turbulent beginning to their convention, Democrats nominated <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> for president on Tuesday, making her the first woman to lead a major party’s ticket in the United States. They then turned to hear from a lineup of speakers that included <Entity>Lena Dunham,</Entity> <Entity>Madeleine Albright</Entity> and former President <Entity>Bill Clinton,</Entity> the night’s main attraction.
Here are the highlights:
• Mr. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> delivered a long, personal recounting of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> life, offering himself up as a witness to her journey from young law student to presidential nominee.
“In the spring of 1971,” Mr. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> began, “I met a girl.”
His tale stretched from their courtship to the birth of their daughter, <Entity>Chelsea,</Entity> and on to her time as secretary of state. He presented Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> as a “change maker” and contrasted his account with the way Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was portrayed at last week’s Republican convention. “One is real,” he said. “The other is made up.”

• Following Mr. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> <Entity>Meryl Streep,</Entity> the award-winning actress, put a cap on the night’s march through Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> career by situating her within the arc of women who have broken down barriers in American public life. “How does she do it? That’s what I want to know,” she said. “Where does she get her grit and her grace? Where do any of our female firsts, our path-breakers, where do they find that strength?”
_____
• At the end of the night, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> appeared live on screen to address the convention. “What an incredible honor that you have given me,” she said, “and I can’t believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet.”
“If there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch,” she added, “let me just say, I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.”
