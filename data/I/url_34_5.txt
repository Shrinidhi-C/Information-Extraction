“Director <Entity>Comey</Entity> is no dummy. I tend to believe that he favored the Republican party during the campaign, ignored the ‘bad news’ and put his finger on the scale. Then, it would seem, he opened his eyes to see just how incompetent <Entity>Trump</Entity> is and is now forced to take action.” — <Entity>WillyD</Entity> in New Jersey
