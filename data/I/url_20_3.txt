Indeed, Asian leaders are sparing no fanfare for Mr. <Entity>Trump.</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Abe</Entity> has invited him to play golf in Tokyo on Sunday, reciprocating for a round at Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in February. Mr. <Entity>Xi</Entity> is throwing him what officials characterize as a “state visit-plus,” with a tour of the Forbidden City and an inspection of troops.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> is bringing 29 chief executives to Beijing, where the administration hopes to announce billions of dollars of new deals for American industry. But officials are playing down expectations that China will agree to any meaningful opening of its markets.
In some respects, said <Entity>Michael J. Green,</Entity> an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> visit is more akin to a trade mission by a Dutch prime minister or a French president than a summit meeting of the leaders of two superpowers.
Still, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> plans to make the North Korea crisis the centerpiece of his stops in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing. General <Entity>McMaster</Entity> said Thursday that the administration was considering putting North Korea on the government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.
In Beijing, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> will press Mr. <Entity>Xi</Entity> to do more to use China’s influence to curb Pyongyang’s behavior. Among his requests, said a person briefed by the White House, are a total cutoff of purchases of North Korean coal, closing North Korean bank accounts and sending home North Korean workers.
“China is definitely doing more,” General <Entity>McMaster</Entity> said, “but obviously it’s not enough.”
