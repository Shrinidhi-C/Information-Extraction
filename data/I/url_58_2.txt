• <Entity>Madeleine Albright,</Entity> who served as secretary of state under Mr. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> and was the first woman to hold the job, delivered a blistering criticism of <Entity>Donald J. Trump’s</Entity> foreign policy credentials. “The truth is that a Trump victory in November would be a gift to <Entity>Vladimir Putin,”</Entity> she said.
In Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> Ms. <Entity>Albright</Entity> said, she sees <Entity>Harry S. Truman’s</Entity> “fighting spirit” as well as someone who has been tested. “We also know what it’s like to step off that plane with the words ‘United States of America’ on it,” Ms. <Entity>Albright</Entity> said. “She knows that safeguarding freedom and security is not like hosting a TV reality show.”

“And I’m <Entity>America Ferrera,</Entity> and according to <Entity>Donald Trump,</Entity> I’m probably a rapist.”
