A September 1985 memo to Bulgarian intelligence from the East German secret police served as a conduit. The disinformation campaign aimed, according to the Stasi, “to generate, for us, a beneficial view by other countries that this disease is the result of out-of-control secret experiments by U.S. intelligence agencies and the Pentagon involving new types of biological weapons.”
A month later, the Soviet journal Literaturnaya Gazeta published a paper titled “Panic in the West or What Is Hiding Behind the Sensation Surrounding AIDS.” It included accurate information about the disease and Fort Detrick but cited the Patriot letter to connect the dots.
The paper received international attention and its allegations were repeated around the world including in Kuwait, Finland and Peru. CBS News, black newspapers, the gay press, niche publications critical of the C.I.A. and the right-wing presidential candidate <Entity>Lyndon LaRouche</Entity> all promoted the conspiracy theory. (Mr. <Entity>LaRouche</Entity> flipped the claim on its head, accusing the Soviets of using AIDS as a weapon.)
It was also cited by former President <Entity>Thabo Mbeki</Entity> of South Africa in rejecting antiretroviral drugs to treat AIDS in the 2000s, contributing to at least one public health crisis. The hip-hop artist <Entity>Kanye West</Entity> has referenced the conspiracy theory — “And I know that the government administered AIDS,” he rapped in 2005 — in at least two popular songs.
The same tactics have shown up in recent years.
Birtherism, the homespun conspiracy theory that President <Entity>Barack Obama</Entity> was not born in the United States, was picked up by Russian state news media and then cited by right-wing groups. The so-called Pizzagate scandal, the baseless allegations that <Entity>John D. Podesta,</Entity> the chairman of <Entity>Hillary Clinton’s</Entity> presidential campaign, abused children in a pizza restaurant, was similarly amplified by Russia accounts.
Mr. <Entity>Selvage</Entity> said those conspiracy theories would have thrived on their own, even without Russian agitation. He said foreign information warriors simply exploited optimal “operational environments.”
“Had U.S. politics not already been polarized, these sort of efforts would have not gotten any traction,” he said. “They’d be whistling in the dark.”
