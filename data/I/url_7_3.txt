<Entity>Marta Tienda,</Entity> a Princeton University professor and an author of a 2013 study that updates Mr. <Entity>Yu’s</Entity> work, said it was inaccurate to just apply the estimated multiplier to the Dreamer population. Her study estimated that each immigrant sponsors an even higher average of relatives — 3.45 — but she emphasized that included all immigrant groups and was driven by employment visas holders, who are much likelier to be naturalized and sponsor foreign relatives.
“You can’t just multiply by 800,000. That’s crazy,” Ms. <Entity>Tienda</Entity> said, adding the average number of relatives sponsored by Dreamers would “absolutely be much lower” than 3.45.
To apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and must have proof of having arrived in the United States before 16. So their children are likelier to be American citizens, and their spouses also legal residents, citizens or Dreamers themselves.
If Dreamers are given a pathway to citizenship through legislation, their parents could indeed eventually obtain legal status. But those who entered the United States illegally are required to leave the country and wait three or 10 years before applying for an immigration visa. That’s “a significant barrier most would be unlikely to contemplate,” according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Because these factors, the Dreamers would sponsor, on average, about one family member over their lifetime, the institute estimated.
Representative <Entity>Adriano Espaillat</Entity> of New York characterized chain migration as parents who want to “reunite with their children.” Representative <Entity>Luis V. Gutiérrez</Entity> of Illinois defined it as immigrations petitioning for their spouses.
Republicans are not suggesting the elimination of family-based immigration, but rather limiting it to a so-called nuclear family — that is, a set of parents and their children.
Over the summer, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> endorsed a bill sponsored by Mr. <Entity>Cotton</Entity> that eliminates family-based immigration for parents, siblings and adult children. But the bill would still allow American citizens and green card holders to sponsor their spouses and children under 21.
It also establishes a visa class for foreign parents to visit their children who are American citizens. House Republicans introduced a similar bill on Wednesday that limits family-based green card programs to spouses and children who are minors.
In 2013, the Senate passed a bill that also eliminated visas for siblings and married sons and daughters over 31, and instead established a point-based system for their immigration. No Democrat voted against it. Though the House did not consider that legislation, Mr. <Entity>Gutiérrez</Entity> was a sponsor of a bill with similar provisions that year, despite characterizing Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> demands to end chain migration and to build a border wall to limit immigration as “ransom.”
