<Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> on Tuesday assailed Justice <Entity>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</Entity> of the Supreme Court for speaking out on the presidential race, calling her disdainful remarks about his candidacy “highly inappropriate” and suggesting that she owed other justices an apology.
Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> remarks came in a telephone interview with The Times two days after Justice <Entity>Ginsburg</Entity> was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the nation would look like if he were elected.
“I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with <Entity>Donald Trump</Entity> as our president,” Justice <Entity>Ginsburg</Entity> told The Times in an interview published Sunday. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” She even joked ruefully about moving to New Zealand.
Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> the presumptive Republican nominee, said he found those remarks unbefitting a member of the high court.
“I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,” Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> said. “I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it.”
He continued: “That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.”
