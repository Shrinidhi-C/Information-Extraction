Breitbart has reported that neither Ms. <Entity>Nelson’s</Entity> stepson nor a man who says he dated Ms. <Entity>Nelson</Entity> in high school believes her claims. Those who say they worked at the restaurant or otherwise frequented it have offered differing accounts on whether Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> was a regular customer.
But Mr. <Entity>Moore</Entity> has contradicted himself on whether he knew his other accusers. He first told <Entity>Sean Hannity</Entity> last month that he remembered <Entity>Debbie Wesson Gibson</Entity> and <Entity>Gloria Thacker Deason,</Entity> but he has recently claimed at campaign stops that “I do not know any of these women.”
Planned Parenthood’s clinics cannot give money to political candidates, and its fund-raising groups are banned from directly donating more than $5,000 to a candidate in an election. Though Planned Parenthood fund-raising groups have donated to other Democratic Senate campaigns, filings to the Federal Election Commission do not reveal contributions to <Entity>Doug Jones,</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Moore’s</Entity> Democratic rival.
Planned Parenthood has not endorsed Mr. <Entity>Jones,</Entity> either. However, its “super PAC,” Planned Parenthood Votes, commissioned a poll in November surveying how views on abortion factored into the Alabama race.
