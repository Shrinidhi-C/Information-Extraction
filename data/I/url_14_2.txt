Mr. <Entity>Pompeo,</Entity> analysts said, would bring other qualities to the State Department that could make him more effective than Mr. <Entity>Tillerson,</Entity> not least his healthy relationship with the president. Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> has won credit at the C.I.A. for consulting the agency’s professional staff, something that Mr. <Entity>Tillerson</Entity> has conspicuously chosen not to do.
But based on his record and recent statements, experts said, Mr. <Entity>Pompeo</Entity> will line up squarely with the hawks in an administration that is already hard-line on issues including Iran and North Korea.
“Pompeo has done nothing but talk about how we need to take the gloves off,” said <Entity>Stephen M. Walt,</Entity> a professor of international relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School. “There’s no reason to believe he would change his views if you put him in charge of the State Department.”
Mr. <Entity>Pompeo’s</Entity> hard-edge views, as the nation’s chief diplomat, might reinforce, rather than restrain, Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> instincts. That could further stiffen American policy toward Iran, where Mr. <Entity>Tillerson,</Entity> along with Defense Secretary <Entity>Jim Mattis,</Entity> urged Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> not to scrap the nuclear deal negotiated by President <Entity>Barack Obama.</Entity>
