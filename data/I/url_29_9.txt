Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> characterized The Times’s coverage of her as schizophrenic, with reliable endorsements of her campaigns on the editorial page offset by persistently negative news coverage. “I suppose this mini-rant guarantees that my book will receive a rip-her-to-shreds review in The Times,” she wrote, “but history will agree that this coverage affected the outcome of the election. Besides, I had to get this off my chest!”
With other targets, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was more judicious, if still stinging. She disparaged Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> as disruptive and hopelessly unrealistic in his proposals. And she criticized President <Entity>Barack Obama</Entity> for urging her not to attack Mr. <Entity>Sanders</Entity> during the primaries (“I felt like I was in a straitjacket”).
