While Mr. <Entity>Netanyahu</Entity> supports the decision to move the American Embassy, Israeli officials have not pushed the issue in recent months. Other leaders in the region, like King <Entity>Abdullah II</Entity> of Jordan, remain deeply opposed to it.
But Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> was under immense pressure from pro-Israel and evangelical supporters and is likely to repeat past assertions that it is not a matter of if, but when, the embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He is also being pressed to declare that next week’s waiver will be his last — effectively promising to devise a plan by mid-2018 to begin relocating the embassy.
Declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital would not itself mark a change in American law. In 1995, Mr. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> signed a statute declaring, “Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the State of Israel.” But administrations have been allowed to decide, as a matter of policy, whether to recognize it as the capital, and none have done so.
That law requires the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, unless the president issues a waiver finding that doing so would be against national security interests of the United States. American presidents have done so every six months since then to avoid prejudging the outcome of — and therefore hampering — an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
As a presidential candidate, Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> vowed to change course. At the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March 2016, he said he would “move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.”
