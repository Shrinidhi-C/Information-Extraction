Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> misled about the deal’s “immediate financial boost” to Iran. 
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> claimed that the deal gave Iran “over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism” and a “massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion.” The diplomatic agreement did not cut Iran a check, but it did release about $100 billion in previously Iranian frozen assets. Much of the amount is tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.
The <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration did transfer $1.7 billion to Iran, but Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> statement requires more context. The money — delivered in cash, some on a plane — was payment for a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal.
Before the 1979 revolution, Iran’s shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. An initial reimbursement was released after the Iran deal was implemented and to help secure the release of American hostages.
