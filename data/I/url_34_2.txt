“These Russian contacts could, potentially, be treason. That puts this at a whole other level. Things are moving at warp speed by D.C. standards. Something big is happening, very big.” — <Entity>RBS</Entity> in Maine

 But many readers were more concerned about United States officials disclosing information about the contacts with Russian intelligence officials. 
“Why are intel officers leaking classified investigations? That should be the real story. The leakers see themselves as above the law.” — <Entity>Brian</Entity> in Boston
“Far too many Trump critics appear not to care that these intelligence agents leaked highly sensitive information to the press — mostly because <Entity>Trump</Entity> critics are pleased with the result.
President <Entity>Trump</Entity> is correct. These leaks are an enormous problem. And in a less polarized context, they would be recognized immediately for what they clearly are: an effort to manipulate public opinion for the sake of achieving a desired political outcome. It is weaponized spin.” — <Entity>Joe Perrino</Entity> in US
“While I’m appalled by <Entity>Michael Flynn’s</Entity> actions and the general ineptitude that is being demonstrated by the new administration, I am equally worried about an aspect of this case that is being overlooked.
Namely, a new American presidential administration and its officials are being undermined and second-guessed by a series of leaks, including intelligence leaks, consisting of material presumably from wiretaps on American citizens, namely <Entity>Flynn</Entity> and possibly others, who were incoming members of that administration.
This is an equally, if not more alarming and ugly development in American democratic politics.” — <Entity>Alan Carmody</Entity> in New York
_____
Other readers  called the matter  evidence of a “witch hunt” against Republicans, or “sour grapes” on the part of Democrats.
“The Republicans won the election and the Democrats are furious with the outcome. The investigation will lead them to the same conclusion: that Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> won fair and square. They cannot fathom that their candidate, <Entity>Hillary Clinton,</Entity> was the loser. It is a case of sour grapes. How much are these continual investigations costing the taxpayers? ” — WMK in New York

Some readers criticized The Times for publishing an article based on four anonymous sources, all credited as current or former American officials.
“Even the unnamed in this article say there is no evidence of a crime. It is all talk, no substance. Hey, look over here, a bunch of calls were made. Then a bunch of subtle hinting at things that never happened. Fake news.” — <Entity>Smoke</Entity> in New York
“Enough. Enough. Enough. This is tantamount to fomenting a coup of a democratically elected government. You are dreadfully irresponsible. You owe the American public more than the anonymous voices of cowards. Treasonous cowards I might add.
You have no right to publish the unfounded, unverified gossip when it has this level of impact. Get the names on record. I want proof, not gossip from moles. If their conviction is so strong, give us names.” — <Entity>Scott Covin</Entity> in Jacksonville, Fla.
“When information was leaked about the unsavory dealings of the DNC, the exposed scandal was mostly ignored and the reporting centered only on how the information was obtained.
Now that the shoe’s on the other foot, the media is focused on accusations and innuendo with little regard for the ‘anonymous’ sources or the fact that they could be leaking classified information, It’s sad that that’s the NYT I’ve come to expect.” — <Entity>Dave T.</Entity> in Chicago
