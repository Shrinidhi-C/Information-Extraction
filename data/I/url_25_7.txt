“We have had access to locations more frequently than many other countries with extensive nuclear programs,” he said of Iran.
After Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> speech on Friday, Mr. <Entity>Amano</Entity> issued his own statement.
“So far, the I.A.E.A. has had access to all locations it needed to visit,” he said. “At present, Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime.”
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> exaggerated when he suggested the deal’s “sunset clauses” are imminent.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> claimed that provisions in the deal limiting Iran’s nuclear abilities expire “in just a few years.” In reality, the major provisions last a decade or longer. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a vocal critic of the deal, said it “largely expires after only 15 years.”
Iran cannot use more than 5,060 centrifuges to enrich uranium — and it cannot pursue research and development on centrifuges — for 10 years. Limits on enrichment levels, facilities and stockpiles last for 15 years, according to a September report from the Congressional Research Service.
Under the terms of the accord, Iran also agreed to convert a deep underground enrichment facility into a “technology center” that cannot contain nuclear material and where the number of centrifuges is limited for 15 years. Several provisions on plutonium, including forbidding the construction of new heavy water reactors, last for 15 years.
Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and related infrastructure for 15 years, verify inventory for 20 years and monitor uranium mines for 25 years.
