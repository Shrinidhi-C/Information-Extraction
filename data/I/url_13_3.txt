News of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> decision came amid fresh disclosures about how, even before he took office, he worked closely with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scuttle a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israel’s settlement policy — subverting then-President <Entity>Barack Obama,</Entity> who had decided to allow a vote to go ahead.
Documents filed in connection with the guilty plea of <Entity>Michael T. Flynn,</Entity> Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> former national security adviser, revealed that on Dec. 22, 2016, a “very senior member” of Mr. <Entity>Trump’s</Entity> transition team instructed Mr. <Entity>Flynn</Entity> to contact foreign officials, including from Russia, “to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.”
Lawyers identified the senior transition official as Mr. <Entity>Kushner.</Entity> Russia rebuffed Mr. <Entity>Flynn’s</Entity> request and voted for the resolution, which passed after the United States abstained.
Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> has kept up his close relations with Mr. <Entity>Netanyahu,</Entity> though that may be tested if, as expected, the White House tries to jump-start peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians early next year.
