CLEVELAND — <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> is officially the Republican presidential nominee  and tonight’s focus at the Republican National Convention — ostensibly, at least — was on jobs and the economy.
The highlights:
• Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> showed up — virtually, from New York, on a Jumbotron to unofficially accept the nomination at little after 9 p.m. But for him, it was both a bit of a wooden and constrained appearance.
He watched on TV as his children helped put him over the top, he said, but gave little of substance, without mentioning <Entity>Hillary Clinton.</Entity>
_____
• For a guy who was passed over for the vice-presidential nomination, and seemed to be kicked around by the <Entity>Trump</Entity> campaign at every turn, Gov. <Entity>Chris Christie</Entity> of New Jersey was the star of the second night.
For about 15 minutes, he laid out one short indictment of Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> after another, asking after each, “Guilty or not guilty?” It was part red meat, part courtroom procedural, and with each query, “GUILTY!” resonated through the hall, interrupted only by an occasional “Lock her up!” (We fact-checked his remarks.)
_____
• For several painful minutes, <Entity>Paul Ryan,</Entity> the House speaker, name-checked Mr. <Entity>Trump,</Entity> always linking him to <Entity>Mike Pence,</Entity> the Republican vice-presidential nominee, and he acknowledged, with some understatement, that “we Republicans have had our differences this year.” He focused on skewering Mrs. <Entity>Clinton.</Entity>
 Fact Check: He said poverty has gotten worse during the almost eight years of the <Entity>Obama</Entity> administration. In fact, the poverty rate did increase in 2009, after he took office, largely as a result of the economic collapse of the previous year. It increased in 2009 to 14.3 percent from 13.2 percent — largely during <Entity>George W. Bush’s</Entity> presidency. It peaked under <Entity>Obama</Entity> at about 15 percent, but fell to about 14.5 percent last year, according to the Census Bureau.
