“Our greatest leaders are often the most humble because they recognize both the awesome responsibilities of power and the frailty of human action,” Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> told an audience that was almost entirely black. The nation, she added, needed “a president who will pray with you and for you.”
In an address that seemed something of an exhale in a week in which Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> has spent much of her time eviscerating her opponent as unqualified to handle national security, the Democratic nominee spoke instead of her activist, social justice background, often fusing policy and personal anecdotes about how her Methodist faith had steered her toward public policy.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> who is often criticized for her lack of self-reflection, said she was “grateful for the great gift of personal salvation and for the great obligation of the social gospel.”
And, as she faces continued criticism over her handling of emails at the State Department, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> conceded she had “plenty” of faults and had made mistakes. “I don’t know anyone who hasn’t,” she said.
“Everyone here today has stumbled on their own stony roads,” she said. “It’s grace that lifts us up, grace that leads us home.”
