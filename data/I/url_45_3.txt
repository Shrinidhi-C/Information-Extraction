Despite the central role Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> Methodism plays in her life, she seldom talks about it on the campaign trail. Such public displays of faith don’t come naturally “to a Midwestern Methodist,” she said.
More than four in 10 voters, regardless of party affiliation, said they believed Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was not very religious, according to a Pew Research Center study on “Faith and the 2016 Campaign” released in January. Among Democrats and voters who lean toward the Democratic Party, about two-thirds said Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> was at least “somewhat” religious; 27 percent said she was not.
But amid the political mudslinging with Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> — and a stubbornly high number of voters who dislike and distrust her — Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> must show voters more of herself and explain her own motivations, aides said.
“We believe we have to work extra hard to make sure the positive notion she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest there is in what he says,” said <Entity>Jennifer Palmieri,</Entity> a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign.
