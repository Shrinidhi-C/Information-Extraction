How does a former senator ... stateswoman ... hoping to build a financial stockpile ... find a way to make it worth her donors’ while?
“Hamilton” tickets.
At a special Tuesday matinee, deep-pocketed supporters of <Entity>Hillary Clinton</Entity> filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show.
But with seats available for $2,700 — and status as “event chair” on offer for $100,000 — the gathering, held for the <Entity>Hillary</Entity> Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times.
“I cry every time,” she said, after embracing the show’s creator, <Entity>Lin-Manuel Miranda,</Entity> who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her.
Mrs. <Entity>Clinton,</Entity> who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her “Hamilton” bona fides, to a point.
