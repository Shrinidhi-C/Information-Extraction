ORLANDO, Fla. — Dystopic. Hard to watch. Terrifying.
<Entity>Hillary Clinton’s</Entity> advisers didn’t mince words as her campaign watched <Entity>Donald J. Trump</Entity> accept the Republican Party’s nomination in Cleveland on Thursday night and his promise to end the “crime and violence that afflicts our nation.”
But mostly, Mrs. <Entity>Clinton’s</Entity> team felt a single emotion: pressure.
“The only thing standing between <Entity>Donald Trump</Entity> and the White House … is us,” the campaign posted on Instagram.
As the campaign prepares for the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday, donors, supporters and elected officials say the vision Mr. <Entity>Trump</Entity> presented for the nation raised the stakes on Mrs. <Entity>Clinton</Entity> to prevail in November.
