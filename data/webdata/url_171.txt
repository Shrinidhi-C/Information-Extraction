                    TAMPA, Fla. -- A Secret Service agent was pulled off Mitt Romney's campaign plane on Wednesday after accidentally leaving her loaded handgun in the bathroom.        

                    A CBS News producer found the gun in the lavatory as the Republican nominee flew from Tampa, Fla., to Indianapolis for a speech on Wednesday. An agent on the plane was alerted and retrieved the gun without incident.        

                    By all accounts, the gun appeared to have been left inadvertently, and Mr. Romney was never considered in any danger. The agent involved stayed behind in Indianapolis to address the matter with her supervisors when Mr. Romney returned to Tampa for the remainder of the Republican National Convention. Romney campaign aides were told about the episode but referred questions to the Secret Service.        

                    "We are aware of the incident," said Ed Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service. "We take the care and custody of our equipment, especially firearms, very seriously. This matter will be dealt with internally and in an appropriate manner."        

                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
