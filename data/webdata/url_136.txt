                    The photo above of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was taken by an Associated Press photographer in Ohio. It is not, as one might reasonably assume, an edited image to go with an article in The Onion.        

                    It is not clear whether Mr. Biden is getting closer to his fictional beer-swilling, chest-baring, bar-fight-starting alter ego dreamed up by the satirical newspaper, or whether images of the real man that seem to reinforce his Joe Everyman character are just getting more popular.        

                    But there are two ways in which the man second in line for the presidency will probably never resemble The Onion's version. First, Mr. Biden does not drink, so the chances that he  will bounce a check at the liquor store are pretty slim. Second, as he told Car and Driver last year, he would not drive the Trans Am that The Onion envisioned him washing shirtless in his driveway. (But just the Trans Am part is unrealistic, he said: "I have been in my bathing suit in my driveway and not only washed my Goodwood-green 1967 Corvette but also Simonized it.")        

                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
