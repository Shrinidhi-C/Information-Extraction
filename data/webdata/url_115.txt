House and Senate negotiators are nearing a modest budget deal to break the cycle of periodic fiscal crises that both parties say have hampered the economy. But for President Obama, the “grand bargain” remains elusive. That wasn’t always the case for Democratic presidents. In fact, some found it much easier to cut deals with Republican legislators.
A major reason is that until quite recently, the two parties’ interests were better aligned, in part because geography trumped ideology.
In the 1940s and ‘50s, the South, with its military tradition and its many Army bases, was a stronghold of support for robust interventions in World War II and then the Cold War, even as northern Democrats joined Midwestern Republicans in favoring a more cautious foreign policy. At the same time, when the first modern civil rights legislation was passed -- in the 1950s and ‘60s -- Republicans in the North were as much opposed to Jim Crow policies as northern Democrats, while the staunchest opposition came from Democrats in the Deep South.
Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Republicans began to make inroads into the “Solid South” and shifted the party’s axis along the Sun Belt. The northern moderate Republicans of the previous decades either left the party or were replaced by conservatives. The Democratic Party also became more ideologically cohesive. In subsequent years this trend has continued, with the result that bipartisanship has become increasingly rare.
